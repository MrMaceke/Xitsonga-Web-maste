Eku sunguleni, Xikwembu xi tumbuluxile tilo ni misava.	In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.
Misava a yi nga ri na xivumbeko, naswona eka yona a ku nga ri na nchumu. Munyama a wu funengetile xidziva lexikulu, moya wa Xikwembu wona wu ri karhi wu hunga-hunga ehenhla ka mati.	The earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.
Kutani Xikwembu xi ku: A ku ve ni ku vonakala. Hiloko ku vonakala ku va kona.	And God said, Let there be light, and there was light.
Xikwembu xi vona leswaku ku vonakala ku sasekile, kutani xi hambanisa munyama ni ku vonakala.	And God saw that the light was good. And God separated the light from the darkness.
Kutani Xikwembu xi thya ku vonakala xi ku i Nhlekanhi, munyama wona xi ku i Vusiku. Kutani ku va madyambu, ku tlhela ku va mixo, ri va siku ro sungula.	God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.
Kutani Xikwembu xi ku: Exikarhi ka mati a ku ve ni mpfhuka lowu nga ta ma hambanisa.	And God said, Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.
Kutani Xikwembu xi endla mpfhuka exikarhi ka mati lama nga hansi ni lama nga henhla, xi ma hambanisa ha wona. Kutani swi va tano.	And God made the expanse and separated the waters that were under the expanse from the waters that were above the expanse. And it was so.
Hiloko Xikwembu xi thya mpfhuka lowu xi ku i Tilo. Kutani ku va madyambu, ku tlhela ku va mixo, ri va siku ra vumbirhi.	And God called the expanse Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, the second day.
Kutani Xikwembu xi ku: Mati lama nga hansi ka tilo a ma hlengeletane endhawini yin'we, kutani ku humelela ndhawu leyi omeke. Hiloko swi va tano.	And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear. And it was so.
Xikwembu xi thya ndhawu leyi omeke xi ku i Misava, mati lama hlengeletaneke xi ku i Lwandle. Kutani Xikwembu xi vona leswaku swilo leswi swi sasekile.	God called the dry land Earth, and the waters that were gathered together he called Seas. And God saw that it was good.
Kutani Xikwembu xi ku: Misava a yi mirise swimila hi tinxaka-xaka ta swona, swi nga leswi tswalaka mbewu ntsena, ni mirhi yo tswala mihandzu leyi nga ni mbewu ya yona endzeni, hi ku hambana-hambana ka yona. Kutani swi va tano.	And God said, Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind, on the earth. And it was so.
Misava yi mirisa swimila, swi nga leswi tswalaka mbewu ntsena hi tinxaka-xaka ta swona, ni mirhi yo tswala mihandzu leyi nga ni mbewu ya yona endzeni, hi ku hambana-hambana ka yona. Kutani Xikwembu xi vona leswaku swilo leswi swi sasekile.	The earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed according to their own kinds, and trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
Kutani ku va madyambu, ku tlhela ku va mixo, ri va siku ra vunharhu.	And there was evening and there was morning, the third day.
Kutani Xikwembu xi ku: A ku ve ni timboni etilweni, leti nga ta hambanisa nhlekanhi ni vusiku, ti komba tinguva, ti komba ni masiku ni malembe.	And God said, Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night. And let them be for signs and for seasons, and for days and years
Timboni leti a ti pfurhe etilweni, ti voninga misava. Kutani swi va tano.	and let them be lights in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth. And it was so.
Xikwembu xi endla timboni timbirhi leti voningaka swinene, lerikulu ri va ro fuma nhlekanhi, kasi leritsongo ri va ro fuma vusiku. Xikwembu xi endla ni tinyeleti.	And God made the two great lights—the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night—and the stars.
Kutani Xikwembu xi veka timboni etilweni leswaku ti ta voninga misava	And God set them in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth
ti va tona leti fumaka nhlekanhi ni vusiku, ti hambanisa munyama ni ku vonakala. Kutani Xikwembu xi vona leswaku swilo leswi swi sasekile.	to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good.
Kutani ku va madyambu, ku tlhela ku va mixo, ri va siku ra vumune.	And there was evening and there was morning, the fourth day.
Kutani Xikwembu xi ku: Ematini a ku ve ni swivumbiwa leswo tala leswi hanyaka, tinyanyana tona a ti hahe empfhukeni.	And God said, Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the heavens.
Hiloko Xikwembu xi tumbuluxa swiharhi leswikulu swa le lwandle, ni swivumbiwa hinkwaswo leswi hanyaka ematini hi ku hambana-hambana ka swona, ni tinyanyana hinkwato hi tinxaka-xaka ta tona. Kutani Xikwembu xi vona leswaku swilo leswi swi sasekile.	So God created the great sea creatures and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarm, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
Hiloko Xikwembu xi swi katekisa, xi ku: Tswalanani mi andza, mi tata malwandle, tinyanyana tona a ti andze emisaveni.	And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.
Kutani ku va madyambu, ku tlhela ku va mixo, ri va siku ra vuntlhanu.	And there was evening and there was morning, the fifth day.
Kutani Xikwembu xi ku: Misava a yi humese swivumbiwa leswi hanyaka hi ku hambana-hambana ka swona: Swifuwo, ni swikokovi, ni swiharhi hi tinxaka-xaka ta swona. Kutani swi va tano.	And God said, Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds—livestock and creeping things and beasts of the earth according to their kinds. And it was so.
Xikwembu xi endla swiharhi ni swifuwo hi tinxaka-xaka ta swona, xi endla ni swikokovi hinkwaswo hi ku hambana-hambana ka swona. Kutani Xikwembu xi vona leswaku swilo leswi swi sasekile.	And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds and the livestock according to their kinds, and everything that creeps on the ground according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
Kutani Xikwembu xi ku: A hi endleni munhu hi xifaniso xa hina, a fana na hina, a ta fuma tinhlampfi ni tinyanyana, a fuma ni swifuwo ni misava, ni swiharhi hinkwaswo emisaveni, ni swikokovi hinkwaswo.	Then God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.
Kutani Xikwembu xi va katekisa, xi ku ka vona: Tswalanani mi andza mi tata misava, mi yi fuma. Mi fuma tinhlampfi ni tinyanyana, ni swivumbiwa hinkwaswo leswi famba-fambaka emisaveni.	And God blessed them. And God said to them, Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth.
Kutani Xikwembu xi ku: Vonani, ximila xin'wana ni xin'wana lexi tswalaka mbewu laha misaveni, ndzi mi nyika xona; ndzi mi nyika ni murhi wun'wana ni wun'wana lowu nga ni mbewu emihandzwini ya wona. Swi ta va swakudya swa n'wina.	And God said, Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is on the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit. You shall have them for food.
Swiharhi hinkwaswo, ni tinyanyana hinkwato, ni swikokovi hinkwaswo, ni swin'wana hinkwaswo leswi hanyaka, swona ndzi swi nyika swimila hinkwaswo swa rihlaza leswaku swi va swakudya swa swona. Kutani swi va tano.	And to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the heavens and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food. And it was so.
Hiloko Xikwembu xi languta swilo hinkwaswo leswi xi swi endleke, kutani xi vona leswaku swilo leswi swi sasekile ngopfu. Kutani ku va madyambu, ku tlhela ku va mixo, ri va siku ra vu-6.	And God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.
Kutani ntirho wo tumbuluxa tilo ni misava, ni hinkwaswo leswi nga ka swona, wu herisa sweswo.	Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
Hi siku ra vu-7, loko Xikwembu xi hetile ntirho wa xona hinkwawo lowu a xi wu endla, xi wisa.	And on the seventh day God finished his work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work that he had done.
Hikokwalaho, Xikwembu xi katekisa siku leri ra vu-7, xi ri endla leri hlawulekeke, hikuva hi siku leri xi wisile entirhweni wa xona hinkwawo lowu xi wu endleke loko xi tumbuluxa swilo.	So God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it God rested from all his work that he had done in creation.
emisaveni a ku nga si mila nchumu, hambi xi ri ximudyana xinene, kumbe byanyi, hikuva HOSI Xikwembu a xi nga si nisa mpfula emisaveni, naswona a ku nga si va na munhu loyi a a ta rima misava.	When no bush of the field was yet in the land and no small plant of the field had yet sprung up—for the LORD God had not caused it to rain on the land, and there was no man to work the ground
Kambe a ku ri ni mati lawa a ma pfelela ma huma ehansi, ma tsakamisa misava hinkwayo.	and a mist was going up from the land and was watering the whole face of the ground
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi vumba munhu hi ntshuri wa misava, xi huhutela moya lowu nyikaka vutomi etinhompfini ta yena, kutani munhu a va xivumbiwa lexi hanyaka.	then the LORD God formed the man of dust from the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living creature.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi endla ntanga le Edeni evuxeni, kutani xi teka munhu loyi xi n'wi vumbeke, xi ya n'wi veka kwale ntangeni.	And the LORD God planted a garden in Eden, in the east, and there he put the man whom he had formed.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi endla leswaku misava yi mirisa mirhi ya tinxaka-xaka leyi kokaka mahlo ni leyi dyiwaka. Exikarhi ka ntanga a ku ri ni murhi lowu nyikaka vutomi, ni murhi lowu nyikaka vutivi bya leswo biha ni leswo saseka.	And out of the ground the LORD God made to spring up every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food. The tree of life was in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
A ku ri ni nambu lowu a wu khuluka wu huma le Edeni wu cheleta ntanga; ku suka entangeni nambu lowu a wu avana, wu huma milambu ya mune.	A river flowed out of Eden to water the garden, and there it divided and became four rivers.
Vito ra nambu wo sungula i Pixoni. Nambu lowu hi wona wu khulukaka wu rhendzeleka ni tiko hinkwaro ra Havhila, laha ku nga ni nsuku.	The name of the first is the Pishon. It is the one that flowed around the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold.
Nsuku lowu kumekaka etikweni leri wu sasekile ngopfu; ku kumeka ni mafurha layo nun'hwela, ni maribye ya nkoka ya onikisi.	And the gold of that land is good; bdellium and onyx stone are there.
Vito ra nambu wa vumbirhi i Gihoni. Nambu lowu hi wona wu khulukaka, wu rhendzeleka ni tiko hinkwaro ra Etiyopiya.	The name of the second river is the Gihon. It is the one that flowed around the whole land of Cush.
Vito ra nambu wa vunharhu i Tigrisi, lowu khulukaka wu ta hi le vuxeni bya tiko ra Asiriya. Vito ra nambu wa vumune i Yufrata.	And the name of the third river is the Tigris, which flows east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.
HOSI Xikwembu xi teka munhu xi n'wi veka entangeni wa Edeni, leswaku a ta wu rima ni ku wu hlayisa.	The LORD God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to work it and keep it.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi byela munhu xi ku: U nga ha tidyela mihandzu ya mirhi hinkwayo leyi nga kona entangeni	And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, You may surely eat of every tree of the garden
kambe loko yi ri mihandzu ya murhi lowu nyikaka vutivi bya leswo biha ni leswo saseka, u nga tshuki u yi dya, hikuva siku u yi dyaka u ta fa!	but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku: A swi sasekanga loko munhu a tshama a ri yexe; ndzi ta n'wi endlela nakulobye loyi a n'wi fanelaka.	Then the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper fit for him.
Hiloko HOSI Xikwembu xi teka misava xi vumba swiharhi hinkwaswo ni tinyanyana hinkwato, kutani xi swi yisa eka munhu ku vona leswaku munhu ú ta swi thya mavito wahi. Kutani vito leri munhu a ri thyeke xivumbiwa xin'wana ni xin'wana, ri vile rona vito ra xona.	Now out of the ground the LORD God had formed every beast of the field and every bird of the heavens and brought them to the man to see what he would call them. And whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name.
Munhu ú thyile swifuwo hinkwaswo, ni tinyanyana hinkwato, ni swiharhi hinkwaswo emavito; kambe yena a a nga si kumeriwa nakulobye loyi a n'wi fanelaka.	The man gave names to all livestock and to the birds of the heavens and to every beast of the field. But for Adam there was not found a helper fit for him.
Hiloko HOSI Xikwembu xi etlerisa munhu vurhongo lebyikulu, kutani loko a ha etlele, xi hlomula rimbambu rin'we eka yena, xi tlhela xi pfala hi nyama laha a ri ri kona.	So the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and while he slept took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi endla wansati hi rimbambu leri xi ri hlomuleke eka munhu, kutani xi n'wi yisa eka yena.	And the rib that the LORD God had taken from the man he made into a woman and brought her to the man.
Leswi hi swona swi endlaka leswaku wanuna a siya tata wa yena ni mana wa yena, a ya namarhela nsati wa yena, va endla nyama yin'we.	Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.
Wanuna ni nsati wa yena a va tshama va nga ambalanga nchumu, kambe a swi nga va khomisi tingana.	And the man and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed.
Kutani wansati a ku ka nyoka: Hi nga ha dya mihandzu ya mirhi hinkwayo leyi nga laha ntangeni	And the woman said to the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden
kambe Xikwembu xi te: ‘Mi nga tshuki mi dya mihandzu ya murhi lowu nga xikarhi ka ntanga, hambi ku ri ku yi khumba mi nga tshuki mi yi khumba, hikuva mi nga fa.’ 	but God said, 'You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.'
Kutani nyoka yi ku ka wansati: Ku fa kona mi nga ka mi nga fi.	But the serpent said to the woman, You will not surely die.
Xikwembu xa swi tiva leswaku loko mo dya, mahlo ya n'wina ma ta pfuleka, kutani mi ta fana na xona, mi tiva swo biha ni leswo saseka.	For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.
Kuteloko wansati a vona leswaku murhi wa kona wa dyiwa, ni leswaku wu koka mahlo, naswona wu nga endla leswaku munhu a tlhariha, a kha mihandzu ya wona, a dya; a teka yin'wana a ya nyika nuna wa yena, a dya.	So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate, and she also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate.
Hiloko havambirhi va pfuleka mahlo, kutani va sungula ku vona leswaku a vo tshama ntsena; kutani va rhungelela matluka ya nkuwa va tiendlela swiambalo.	Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked. And they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loincloths.
Hi nkarhi wa madyambu, wanuna ni nsati wa yena va twa HOSI Xikwembu xi ri karhi xi famba-famba entangeni. Kutani va tumbela exikarhi ka mirhi entangeni, va chava ku voniwa hi HOSI Xikwembu.	And they heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden.
Hiloko HOSI Xikwembu xi vitana wanuna xi ku ka yena: U kwihi xana?	But the LORD God called to the man and said to him, Where are you?
Kutani yena a ku: Ndzi ku twile loko u famba-famba entangeni, kutani ndzi ya tumbela hikuva a ndzi chava, leswi a ndzi nga ambalanga nchumu.	And he said, I heard the sound of you in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked, and I hid myself.
HOSI Xikwembu xi ku: U byele hi mani leswaku a wu ambalanga nchumu xana? Xana u lo dya mihandzu ya murhi lowu ndzi nga ku lerisa leswaku u nga tshuki u yi dya, xana?	He said, Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten of the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?
Wanuna a ku: Wansati loyi u ndzi nyikeke yena leswaku ndzi tshama na yena, hi yena a ndzi nyikeke mihandzu ya murhi wa kona, kutani mina ndzi lo dya.	The man said, The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit of the tree, and I ate.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka wansati: I mhaka muni leyi u yi endleke xana? Wansati a ku: Mina ndzi lo kanganyisiwa hi nyoka, kutani ndzi dya.	Then the LORD God said to the woman, What is this that you have done? The woman said, The serpent deceived me, and I ate.
Adamu a thya nsati wa yena evito ra Evha, hikuva ú ve yena mana wa vanhu hinkwavo.	The man called his wife's name Eve, because she was the mother of all living.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi endlela Adamu ni nsati wa yena swiambalo swa madzovo, xi va ambexa swona.	And the LORD God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skins and clothed them.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku: Vonani, sweswi munhu ú fana na hina, ú tiva swo biha ni leswo saseka, kutani a nga tshuka a kha ni mihandzu ya murhi lowu nyikaka vutomi, a dya, kutani a hanya hilaha ku nga heriki.	Then the LORD God said, Behold, the man has become like one of us in knowing good and evil. Now, lest he reach out his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat, and live forever—
Hikokwalaho, HOSI Xikwembu xi humesa munhu entangeni wa Edeni, leswaku a ya rima misava leyi a vumbiweke ha yona.	therefore the LORD God sent him out from the garden of Eden to work the ground from which he was taken.
HOSI Xikwembu xi hlongola munhu entangeni wa Edeni, kutani evuxeni bya ntanga lowu xi veka tikerubu ni fumu leri vangamaka, ri tshama ri ri karhi ri rhendzeleka-rhendzeleka, swi rindza ndlela yo ya emurhini lowu nyikaka vutomi.	He drove out the man, and at the east of the garden of Eden he placed the cherubim and a flaming sword that turned every way to guard the way to the tree of life.
Adamu a tiva nsati wa yena Evha, hiloko Evha a tika, a veleka Kayini, kutani a ku: Hi ku pfuniwa hi HOSI, ndzi kumile n'wana wa mufana.	Now Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore Cain, saying, I have gotten a man with the help of the LORD.
Evha a tlhela a veleka n'wana wa mufana, a nga Avele. Avele a a ri mufuwi wa tinyimpfu, Kayini yena a a ri murimi.	And again, she bore his brother Abel. Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, and Cain a worker of the ground.
Siku rin'wana, Kayini a humesela HOSI Xikwembu gandzelo hi mihandzu ya masimu ya yena	In the course of time Cain brought to the LORD an offering of the fruit of the ground
kasi Avele yena ú lo pambula swinyimpfana leswi noneke swa mativula exikarhi ka ntlhambi wa yena, a humesela HOSI Xikwembu. Kutani xona xi amukela Avele ni gandzelo ra yena	and Abel also brought of the firstborn of his flock and of their fat portions. And the LORD had regard for Abel and his offering
kambe a xi vulanga nchumu hi Kayini ni gandzelo ra yena. Kutani Kayini a hlundzuka swinene, a visingarisa ni xikandza.	but for Cain and his offering he had no regard. So Cain was very angry, and his face fell.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Kayini: Xana u hlundzukela yini xana? Hikwalaho ka yini u visingarisa xikandza xana?	The LORD said to Cain, Why are you angry, and why has your face fallen?
Xana loko wo endla leswinene, u nge tsakeriwi xana? Loko u nga endli leswinene, xidyoho xi ta ku bvutamela enyangweni, xi navela ku ku bvanyangeta, kambe u fanele ku xi hlula.	If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the door. Its desire is contrary to you, but you must rule over it.
Kayini a ku ka makwavo Avele: A hi ye hala masin'wini. Loko va ri kwale masin'wini, Kayini a hundzukela makwavo Avele, a n'wi dlaya.	Cain spoke to Abel his brother. And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel and killed him.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi vutisa Kayini xi ku: Makwenu Avele ú kwihi xana? Kayini a hlamula a ku: A ndzi tivi; xana mina ndzi murisi wa makwerhu xana?	Then the LORD said to Cain, Where is Abel your brother? He said, I do not know; am I my brother's keeper?
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku: Xana u endle yini xana? Ngati ya makwenu yi huwelela eka mina yi ri emisaveni!	And the LORD said, What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood is crying to me from the ground.
Kutani sweswi u ta rhuketeriwa hi misava leyi yi ahlamiseke nomo yi amukela ngati ya makwenu loyi u n'wi dlayeke.	And now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.
Loko u rima misava, a yi nga ha ku humeseli ntshovelo lowu ringaneke. Emisaveni a wu nga vi na kaya, u ta va mutsendzeleki.	When you work the ground, it shall no longer yield to you its strength. You shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth.
Kayini a ku ka HOSI Xikwembu: Ku biwa ka mina i kukulu, a ku ndzi ringananga!	Cain said to the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear.
Vona, namuntlha u ndzi hlongorile laha tikweni, kutani ndzi ta va kule na wena. A ndzi nga ha vi na kaya, ndzi ta va mutsendzeleki laha misaveni. Un'wana ni un'wana loyi a nga ta ndzi kuma, ú ta ndzi dlaya.	Behold, you have driven me today away from the ground, and from your face I shall be hidden. I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka yena: E-e, a swi nga vi tano! Loko un'wana a nga tshuka a ku dlele, ú ta riha ka 7. Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi fungha Kayini, hikuva loko a swi nga ri tano, munhu un'wana ni un'wana loyi a a ta hlangana na Kayini, a a ta n'wi dlaya.	Then the LORD said to him, Not so! If anyone kills Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD put a mark on Cain, lest any who found him should attack him.
Hiloko Kayini a suka emahlweni ka HOSI Xikwembu, a ya tshama etikweni ra Nodo, evuxeni bya Edeni.	Then Cain went away from the presence of the LORD and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden.
Kutani Kayini a tiva nsati wa yena; hiloko nsati wa yena a tika, a veleka Enoko; kutani Kayini a aka muti, a wu thya vito ra n'wana wa yena Enoko.	Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch. When he built a city, he called the name of the city after the name of his son, Enoch.
Kutani Enoko a veleka Irada, Irada a veleka Mehuyaele; Mehuyaele a veleka Metuxaele; Metuxaele a veleka Lameke.	To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad fathered Mehujael, and Mehujael fathered Methushael, and Methushael fathered Lamech.
Kutani Lameke a teka vasati vambirhi. Mavito ya vona i Ada na Sila.	And Lamech took two wives. The name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.
Kutani Ada a veleka Yabala, tata wa vafuwi lava tshamaka emintsongeni.	Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock.
Makwavo wa Yabala a a ri Yubala, tata wa hinkwavo lava chayaka switende ni tinanga.	His brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all those who play the lyre and pipe.
Sila a veleka Tubala-Kayini, mufuri wa switirho hinkwaswo swa koporo ni swa nsimbhi. Makwavo wa xisati wa Tubala-Kayini a a ri Naama.	Zillah also bore Tubal-cain; he was the forger of all instruments of bronze and iron. The sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.
Kutani Adamu a tlhela a tiva nsati wa yena, kutani nsati wa yena a veleka n'wana wa mufana, a n'wi thya vito ra Seta, hikuva a a ku: Xikwembu xi ndzi nyikile n'wana un'wana ku siva Avele loyi a dlayeke hi Kayini.	And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son and called his name Seth, for she said, God has appointed for me another offspring instead of Abel, for Cain killed him.
Seta na yena a kuma n'wana wa mufana, kutani a n'wi thya vito ra Enosi. Enkarhini wa kona, vanhu va sungula ku khongela HOSI Xikwembu hi vito ra xona.	To Seth also a son was born, and he called his name Enosh. At that time people began to call upon the name of the LORD.
Lowu i nongonoko wa va ka Adamu. Loko Xikwembu xi tumbuluxa munhu, xi n'wi endlile a fana na xona.	This is the book of the generations of Adam. When God created man, he made him in the likeness of God.
Xikwembu xi tumbuluxile munhu wa xinuna ni wa xisati, kutani xi va katekisa. Siku xi va tumbuluxeke, xi va thyile vito ra Munhu.	Male and female he created them, and he blessed them and named them Man when they were created.

Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku: Moya wa mina a wu nga ha tshami hilaha ku nga heriki eka munhu, hikuva munhu ú tsanile, kutani ú ta hanya ntsena malembe ya 120.	Then the LORD said, My Spirit shall not abide in man forever, for he is flesh: his days shall be 120 years.
Enkarhini wolowo, ni le minkarhini leyi landzeleke, ku vile ni swihontlovila leswi velekiweke loko tintsumi ta le tilweni ti hlanganile ni vanhwanyana va laha misaveni. Swihontlovila leswi, hi tona tinhenha ta khale to tiveka ngopfu.	The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of man and they bore children to them. These were the mighty men who were of old, the men of renown.
Loko HOSI Xikwembu xi vona leswaku ku dyoha ka munhu i kukulu laha misaveni, ni leswaku makungu hinkwawo ya mbilu ya yena ma bihile minkarhi hinkwayo	The LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
xi vaviseka embilwini, xi tilaya leswi xi endleke munhu emisaveni	And the LORD regretted that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart.
kutani xi ku: Ndzi ta herisa vanhu lava ndzi va tumbuluxeke laha misaveni, ni swiharhi, ni swikokovi, ni tinyanyana. Ndza tilaya, leswi ndzi vumbeke swilo leswi.	So the LORD said, I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land, man and animals and creeping things and birds of the heavens, for I am sorry that I have made them.
Kambe Nowa yena a a tsakeriwa hi HOSI Xikwembu.	But Noah found favor in the eyes of the LORD.
Leti i timhaka ta va ka Nowa. Nowa a a ri munhu wo lulama, loyi a a tsakisa Xikwembu ku tlula vanhu hinkwavo lava a va ri kona emisaveni; naswona a a ri ni xinakulobye ni Xikwembu.	These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his generation. Noah walked with God.
Nowa a a ri ni vana vanharhu, Xeme na Hamu na Yafeta.	And Noah had three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
Enkarhini lowu, Xikwembu xi vona leswaku misava yi onhakile, yi tele hi vanhu va tihanyi.	Now the earth was corrupt in God's sight, and the earth was filled with violence.
Loko xi yi languta, xi vona leswaku yi onhakile, hikuva vanhu hinkwavo emisaveni a va endla leswo biha.	And God saw the earth, and behold, it was corrupt, for all flesh had corrupted their way on the earth.
Kutani Xikwembu xi ku ka Nowa: Ndzi ni makungu ya ku herisa vanhu hinkwavo, hikuva misava yi tele tihanyi hikwalaho ka vona. Kutani ndzi ta va herisa swin'we ni misava.	And God said to Noah, I have determined to make an end of all flesh, for the earth is filled with violence through them. Behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
Tiendlele ngalava hi timhandze ta murhi wa gofere. Endzeni ka ngalava ya kona, u endla makamari; u tota ni ntita endzeni ni le handle ka yona.	Make yourself an ark of gopher wood. Make rooms in the ark, and cover it inside and out with pitch.
Ngalava yi fanele ku va ni mimpimo leyi: 150 m ku leha, 25 m ku anama, ni 15 m ku ya ehenhla.	This is how you are to make it: the length of the ark 300 cubits, its breadth 50 cubits, and its height 30 cubits.
Endla lwangu ra yona, u siya 50 cm exikarhi ka lwangu na khumbi, u vekela ni rivanti hala tlhelo ka yona; ngalava ya kona u yi endla yi va ni tindlu ta le hansi, ni ta le xikarhi, ni ta le henhla.	Make a roof for the ark, and finish it to a cubit above, and set the door of the ark in its side. Make it with lower, second, and third decks.
Sweswi ndzi lava ku rhumela ndhambi ya mati, yi ta herisa swivumbiwa hinkwaswo leswi hanyaka emisaveni. Swilo hinkwaswo leswi nga laha misaveni swi ta fa.	For behold, I will bring a flood of waters upon the earth to destroy all flesh in which is the breath of life under heaven. Everything that is on the earth shall die.
Kambe ndzi ta endla ntwanano na wena; kutani u ta nghena engalaveni wena, ni nsati wa wena, ni vana va wena, ni vasati va vona.	But I will establish my covenant with you, and you shall come into the ark, you, your sons, your wife, and your sons' wives with you.
Kutani exikarhi ka swivumbiwa hinkwaswo swa tinxaka-xaka leswi hanyaka, u ta teka swimbirhi-mbirhi, xa xinuna ni xa xisati, u nghena na swona engalaveni, leswaku na swona swi ta pona.	And of every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring two of every sort into the ark to keep them alive with you. They shall be male and female.
Exikarhi ka tinyanyana hinkwato, ni swiharhi hinkwaswo, ni swikokovi hinkwaswo, u ta nghena ni swimbirhi swa rixaka rin'wana ni rin'wana, leswaku na swona swi ta pona.	Of the birds according to their kinds, and of the animals according to their kinds, of every creeping thing of the ground, according to its kind, two of every sort shall come in to you to keep them alive.
U fanele ku teka ni swakudya hi tinxaka-xaka ta swona, u swi hlayisa, swi ta dyiwa hi wena ni swivumbiwa leswin'wana.	Also take with you every sort of food that is eaten, and store it up. It shall serve as food for you and for them.
Hiloko Nowa a endla swilo leswi hinkwaswo, hilaha Xikwembu xi n'wi leriseke hakona.	Noah did this; he did all that God commanded him.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Nowa: Teka va ndyangu wa wena hinkwavo, u nghena na vona engalaveni, hikuva ndzi swi vonile leswaku exikarhi ka vanhu hinkwavo lava nga laha misaveni, hi wena ntsena u lulameke emahlweni ka mina.	Then the LORD said to Noah, Go into the ark, you and all your household, for I have seen that you are righteous before me in this generation.
Exikarhi ka rixaka rin'wana ni rin'wana ra swiharhi leswi tengeke, u ta pambula swiharhi swa 14, swa xinuna swa 7 ni swa xisati swa 7, kasi exikarhi ka rixaka rin'wana ni rin'wana ra swiharhi leswi nga tengangiki, u ta pambula swiharhi swimbirhi, xin'we xa xinuna ni xin'we xa xisati.	Take with you seven pairs of all clean animals, the male and his mate, and a pair of the animals that are not clean, the male and his mate
Eka tinyanyana, u ta pambula ta 14 exikarhi ka rixaka rin'wana na rin'wana, ta xinuna ta 7 ni ta xisati ta 7, leswaku rixaka ra kona ri ta ka ri nga nyamalali	and seven pairs of the birds of the heavens also, male and female, to keep their offspring alive on the face of all the earth.
hikuva loko ku nga si hundza masiku ya 7, ndzi ta rhumela mpfula emisaveni, leyi nga ta na masiku ya 40 ni vusiku bya kona. Swilo hinkwaswo leswi hanyaka leswi ndzi swi endleke emisaveni ndzi ta swi herisela makumu.	For in seven days I will send rain on the earth forty days and forty nights, and every living thing that I have made I will blot out from the face of the ground.
Kutani Nowa a endla hinkwaswo leswi HOSI Xikwembu xi n'wi leriseke swona.	And Noah did all that the LORD had commanded him.
Loko ku va ni ndhambi ya mati emisaveni, Nowa a a ri ni malembe ya 600.	Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters came upon the earth.
Nowa, ni nsati wa yena, ni vana va yena, ni vasati va vona, va nghena endzeni ka ngalava, hi ku chava ndhambi ya mati.	And Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives with him went into the ark to escape the waters of the flood.
Exikarhi ka swiharhi leswi tengeke, ni ka leswi nga tengangiki, ni ka tinyanyana, ni ka swikokovi hinkwaswo	Of clean animals, and of animals that are not clean, and of birds, and of everything that creeps on the ground
ku vile ni swimbirhi-mbirhi, xa xinuna ni xa xisati, leswi ngheneke na Nowa engalaveni hilaha Xikwembu xi n'wi leriseke hakona.	two and two, male and female, went into the ark with Noah, as God had commanded Noah.
Kutani endzhaku ka masiku ya 7, ku sungula ndhambi ya mati emisaveni.	And after seven days the waters of the flood came upon the earth.
Elembeni leri Nowa a veke ni malembe ya 600 ha rona, hi siku ra vu-17 ra n'hweti ya vumbirhi, swidziva hinkwaswo swa mati swi khapa, ni tinyangwa ta mati ya le tilweni ti pfuleka.	In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the fountains of the great deep burst forth, and the windows of the heavens were opened.
Kutani ku na mpfula emisaveni ku ringana masiku ya 40 ni vusiku bya kona.	And rain fell upon the earth forty days and forty nights.
Hi siku rero, Nowa a teka nsati wa yena, ni vana va yena Xeme, na Hamu, na Yafeta, ni vasati va vona vanharhu, a nghena na vona engalaveni.	On the very same day Noah and his sons, Shem and Ham and Japheth, and Noah's wife and the three wives of his sons with them entered the ark
Va nghenile ni tinxaka to hambana-hambana ta swiharhi, ni ta swifuwo, ni ta swikokovi, ni ta tinyanyana hinkwato ta muhlovu-hlovu.	they and every beast, according to its kind, and all the livestock according to their kinds, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, according to its kind, and every bird, according to its kind, every winged creature.
Nowa ú nghenile engalaveni a ri ni swivumbiwa swimbirhi-mbirhi, exikarhi ka swivumbiwa hinkwaswo leswi hanyaka.	They went into the ark with Noah, two and two of all flesh in which there was the breath of life.
Swivumbiwa hinkwaswo swa xinuna ni swa xisati leswi ngheneke engalaveni, swi nghenile hilaha Xikwembu xi leriseke Nowa hakona. Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi pfalela Nowa engalaveni.	And those that entered, male and female of all flesh, went in as God had commanded him. And the LORD shut him in.
Ndhambi ya mati yi va kona emisaveni ku ringana masiku ya 40, mati ma ri karhi ma ndlandlamuka, ma tlakula ngalava yi suka ehansi.	The flood continued forty days on the earth. The waters increased and bore up the ark, and it rose high above the earth.
Kutani mati ma ya ma ndlandlamuka swinene, ngalava yi kondza yi papama ehenhla ka wona.	The waters prevailed and increased greatly on the earth, and the ark floated on the face of the waters.
Loko mati ma ndlandlamukile hi matimba swinene, ma funengetile ni tintshava hinkwato leto leha emisaveni	And the waters prevailed so mightily on the earth that all the high mountains under the whole heaven were covered.
ma tlhela ma ti hundza hi 7,5 m.	The waters prevailed above the mountains, covering them fifteen cubits deep.
Kutani swivumbiwa hinkwaswo leswi hanyaka emisaveni swi fetetela. Ku file tinyanyana, ni swifuwo, ni swiharhi, ni swihadyana hinkwaswo leswi tateke misava, ni vanhu hinkwavo.	And all flesh died that moved on the earth, birds, livestock, beasts, all swarming creatures that swarm on the earth, and all mankind.
Xilo xin'wana ni xin'wana laha misaveni lexi xi hefemulaka, xi file.	Everything on the dry land in whose nostrils was the breath of life died.
HOSI yi herisile swivumbiwa hinkwaswo leswi hanyaka emisaveni: Vanhu, ni swiharhi, ni swikokovi, ni tinyanyana, swi herisiwa hinkwaswo, ku pona ntsena Nowa ni lava a a ri na vona engalaveni.	He blotted out every living thing that was on the face of the ground, man and animals and creeping things and birds of the heavens. They were blotted out from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those who were with him in the ark.
Mati ma ndlandlamukile ma ya ehenhla ku ringana masiku ya 150.	And the waters prevailed on the earth 150 days.
Kutani Xikwembu xi tsundzuka Nowa ni swiharhi hinkwaswo ni swifuwo hinkwaswo leswi a a ri na swona engalaveni; hiloko xi hungisa moya emisaveni, kutani mati ma sungula ku hunguteka.	But God remembered Noah and all the beasts and all the livestock that were with him in the ark. And God made a wind blow over the earth, and the waters subsided.
Mati ya le swidziveni ma yima ku khapa, ni tinyangwa ta mati ya le tilweni ti pfaleka, mpfula yi xa.	The fountains of the deep and the windows of the heavens were closed, the rain from the heavens was restrained
Kutani hi kutsongo-tsongo, mati ma sungula ku ya ehansi. Endzhaku ka masiku ya 150, mati a ma hungutekile swinene.	and the waters receded from the earth continually. At the end of 150 days the waters had abated
Hi siku ra vu-17 ra n'hweti ya vu-7, ngalava yi ya yima entshaveni le Ararata.	and in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat.
Mati ma ya emahlweni ma hunguteka, ku kondza ku fika n'hweti ya vukhume, kutani hi siku ro sungula ra n'hweti ya vukhume, tinhlohlorhi ta tintshava ti sungula ku vonaka.	And the waters continued to abate until the tenth month; in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were seen.
Loko ku hundzile masiku ya 40, Nowa a pfula fasitere leri a ri endleke engalaveni	At the end of forty days Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made
a humesa wukuwuku, kutani rona ri ya haha-haha ehandle mati ma kondza ma phya.	and sent forth a raven. It went to and fro until the waters were dried up from the earth.
Hiloko a humesa tuva, leswaku ri ya kamba loko mati ma phyile emisaveni.	Then he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters had subsided from the face of the ground.
Kambe tuva a ri kumanga laha ri nga phatsamaka kona, hikuva mati a ma ha funengetile misava hinkwayo. Hiloko ri tlhelela eka Nowa engalaveni, kutani Nowa a humesa voko a teka tuva, a ri tlherisela engalaveni laha a a ri kona.	But the dove found no place to set her foot, and she returned to him to the ark, for the waters were still on the face of the whole earth. So he put out his hand and took her and brought her into the ark with him.
Nowa a tshama masiku ya 7, kutani a tlhela a humesa tuva engalaveni.	He waited another seven days, and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark.
Kutani tuva ri vuya nimadyambu ri lumile tluka lera ha ku khiwaka emurhini wa mutlhwari. Kutani Nowa a swi tiva leswaku mati ma hungutekile emisaveni.	And the dove came back to him in the evening, and behold, in her mouth was a freshly plucked olive leaf. So Noah knew that the waters had subsided from the earth.
A tlhela a tshama masiku ya 7, kutani a humesa tuva engalaveni, kambe rona a ra ha vuyanga.	Then he waited another seven days and sent forth the dove, and she did not return to him anymore.
Loko Nowa a ri ni malembe ya 601, hi siku ro sungula ra n'hweti yo sungula, mati a ma phyile emisaveni; kutani Nowa a pfula lwangu ra ngalava, a hlometela emisaveni, kutani a kuma leswaku misava a yi sungula ku oma.	In the six hundred and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried from off the earth. And Noah removed the covering of the ark and looked, and behold, the face of the ground was dry.
Hi siku ra 27 ra n'hweti ya vumbirhi, misava a yi omile.	In the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth had dried out.
Kutani Xikwembu xi ku ka Nowa	Then God said to Noah
Huma engalaveni ni nsati wa wena, ni vana va wena ni vasati va vona	Go out from the ark, you and your wife, and your sons and your sons' wives with you.
u huma ni swivumbiwa hinkwaswo leswi hanyaka leswi u nga na swona, ti nga tinyanyana, ni swiharhi, ni swikokovi hinkwaswo, leswaku swi ta tswalana, swi andza, swi tata misava.	Bring out with you every living thing that is with you of all flesh—birds and animals and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth—that they may swarm on the earth, and be fruitful and multiply on the earth.
Kutani Nowa ni nsati wa yena, ni vana va yena ni vasati va vona, va huma engalaveni.	So Noah went out, and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives with him.
Swiharhi hinkwaswo, ni swikokovi hinkwaswo, ni tinyanyana hinkwato, ni swilo hinkwaswo leswi hanyaka emisaveni, swi huma engalaveni hi tinxaka ta swona.	Every beast, every creeping thing, and every bird, everything that moves on the earth, went out by families from the ark.
Nowa a akela HOSI Xikwembu alitari, kutani a pambula xiharhi xin'we exikarhi ka rixaka rin'wana ni rin'wana ra swiharhi leswi tengeke, a pambula ni xinyanyana xin'we exikarhi ka rixaka rin'wana ni rin'wana ra tinyanyana leti tengeke, a humesa gandzelo leri hisiwaka.	Then Noah built an altar to the LORD and took some of every clean animal and some of every clean bird and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
Loko HOSI Xikwembu xi twa ku nun'hwela ka gandzelo ra kona, yi vulavula hi mbilu yi ku: A ndzi nga ha tlheli ndzi rhuketela misava hikwalaho ka ku dyoha ka munhu, hambileswi munhu a ehleketaka swo biha ku sukela evuhlangini bya yena. Naswona a ndzi nga ha engeti ndzi herisa swivumbiwa leswi hanyaka, tani hilaha ndzi endleke hakona.	And when the LORD smelled the pleasing aroma, the LORD said in his heart, I will never again curse the ground because of man, for the intention of man's heart is evil from his youth. Neither will I ever again strike down every living creature as I have done.
Loko misava ya ha ri kona,
ku byala ni ku tshovela,
xirhami ni mumu,
ximumu ni xixika,
nhlekanhi ni vusiku,
swi nga ka swi nga yimi!	While the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night, shall not cease.
Kutani Xikwembu xi katekisa Nowa ni vana va yena, xi ku ka vona: Tswalanani mi andza, mi tata misava.	And God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth.
Swiharhi hinkwaswo, ni tinyanyana hinkwato, ni swikokovi hinkwaswo, ni tinhlampfi hinkwato, swi ta mi chava swinene; swilo leswi swi ta lawuriwa hi n'wina.	The fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth and upon every bird of the heavens, upon everything that creeps on the ground and all the fish of the sea. Into your hand they are delivered.
Swilo hinkwaswo leswi hanyaka swi ta va swakudya swa n'wina; ndzi mi nyika swona hinkwaswo, ku fana ni leswi ndzi mi nyikeke swimila swa rihlaza.	Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you. And as I gave you the green plants, I give you everything.
Kambe mi nga tshuki mi dya nyama ni ngati ya yona, hikuva ngati i vutomi.	But you shall not eat flesh with its life, that is, its blood.
Loko ngati ya munhu yi halatiwa, ndzi ta endla leswaku yi rihiwa: Hambi yi halatiwa hi xiharhi kumbe hi munhu, yi ta rihiwa.	And for your lifeblood I will require a reckoning: from every beast I will require it and from man. From his fellow man I will require a reckoning for the life of man.
Kambe n'wina tswalanani mi andza, mi tata misava mi yi fuma.	And you, be fruitful and multiply, increase greatly on the earth and multiply in it.
Kutani Xikwembu xi byela Nowa ni vana va yena, xi ku	Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him
Sweswi ndzi endla ntwanano na n'wina, ni vana va n'wina lava nga ta velekiwa	Behold, I establish my covenant with you and your offspring after you
ni swivumbiwa hinkwaswo leswi mi hanyaka na swona emisaveni, ku nga tinyanyana, ni swifuwo, ni swiharhi hinkwaswo, swi nga swilo hinkwaswo leswi humeke engalaveni.	and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the livestock, and every beast of the earth with you, as many as came out of the ark; it is for every beast of the earth.
Ntwanano lowu ndzi wu endlaka na n'wina hi lowu: Ni siku ni rin'we swivumbiwa swi nge he pfuki swi herisiwile hinkwaswo hi ndhambi ya mati; naswona, ku nga ka ku nga ha vi na ndhambi yin'wana ya mati leyi nga ta herisa misava.	I establish my covenant with you, that never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of the flood, and never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth.
Xikwembu xi ku: Ku ta va ni xitsundzuxo xa ntwanano lowu ndzi wu endlaka exikarhi ka mina na n'wina, ni swivumbiwa hinkwaswo leswi mi hanyaka na swona, ni leswi nga ta velekiwa eminkarhini leyi taka. Xitsundzuxo xa kona hi lexi	And God said, This is the sign of the covenant that I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for all future generations
Ndzi vekela nkwangulatilo emapapeni lowu nga ta va xitsundzuxo xa ntwanano exikarhi ka mina ni misava.	I have set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and the earth.
Loko ndzi funengeta misava hi mapapa, kutani ku vonaka nkwangulatilo	When I bring clouds over the earth and the bow is seen in the clouds
ndzi ta tsundzuka ntwanano lowu nga kona exikarhi ka mina na n'wina ni swivumbiwa hinkwaswo swa tinxaka-xaka leswi hanyaka. Ku nga ka ku nga ha vi na mati ya ndhambi lama nga ta herisa swivumbiwa hinkwaswo.	I will remember my covenant that is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh. And the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh.
Loko nkwangulatilo wu humelela emapapeni, ndzi ta wu vona, kutani ndzi ta tsundzuka ntwanano lowu nga kona hilaha ku nga heriki exikarhi ka mina Xikwembu ni swivumbiwa hinkwaswo leswi hanyaka emisaveni.	When the bow is in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth.
Kutani Xikwembu xi ku ka Nowa: Lexi hi xona xitsundzuxo xa ntwanano lowu ndzi wu endleke exikarhi ka mina ni swivumbiwa hinkwaswo leswi nga kona emisaveni.	God said to Noah, This is the sign of the covenant that I have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth.
Vana va Nowa lava nga huma engalaveni i Xeme, na Hamu, na Yafeta. Hamu a a ri tata wa Kanana.	The sons of Noah who went forth from the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. (Ham was the father of Canaan.)
Lava hi vona vana vanharhu va Nowa; eka vona ku humile vanhu hinkwavo lava tateke misava.	These three were the sons of Noah, and from these the people of the whole earth were dispersed.
Nowa a a ri murimi; hi yena munhu wo sungula ku rima nsimu a byala vhinya.	Noah began to be a man of the soil, and he planted a vineyard.
Siku rin'wana, a nwa vhinyo ya kona, a pyopyiwa, kutani a ya etlela entsongeni wa yena a nga ambalanga nchumu.	He drank of the wine and became drunk and lay uncovered in his tent.
Kutani Hamu tata wa Kanana a vona tata wa yena a nga ambalanga nchumu, hiloko a suka a ya byela vamakwavo ehandle.	And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father and told his two brothers outside.
Kutani Xeme na Yafeta va teka nkumba va wu kapeka emakatleni ya vona havambirhi, va tlhentlha hi xindzhakwa-ndzhakwani, va ya funengeta tata wa vona; a va langutile etlhelo, hikokwalaho a va n'wi vonelanga.	Then Shem and Japheth took a garment, laid it on both their shoulders, and walked backward and covered the nakedness of their father. Their faces were turned backward, and they did not see their father's nakedness.
Loko vhinyo leyi Nowa a a yi nwile yi hangalaka, a twa leswi n'wana wa yena lontsongo a n'wi endleke swona	When Noah awoke from his wine and knew what his youngest son had done to him
Endzhaku ka ndhambi ya mati, Nowa ú hanyile malembe ya 350	After the flood Noah lived 350 years.
kutani a lova a ri ni malembe ya 950.	All the days of Noah were 950 years, and he died.
Lava i vatukulu va Nowa, va nga vana va Xeme na Hamu na Yafeta, lava velekiweke endzhaku ka ndhambi ya mati.	These are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Sons were born to them after the flood.
Vana va Yafeta hi lava: Gomere, na Magogo, na Madayi, na Yavhani, na Tubala, na Mexeke, na Tirasi.	The sons of Japheth: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.
Vana va Gomere hi lava: Axikenazi, na Rifata, na Togarima.	The sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.
Vana va Yavhani hi lava: Elixa, na Tarxixi, na Kipra, na Rhoda.	The sons of Javan: Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.
Eka vona lava, ku humile vanhu lava hangalakeke ematikweni lama nga etibuweni ta malwandle, hi ku ya hi tinxaka ta vona leti vulavulaka tindzimi to hambana-hambana.	From these the coastland peoples spread in their lands, each with his own language, by their clans, in their nations.
Vana va Hamu hi lava: Kuxi, na Egipta, na Putu, na Kanana.	The sons of Ham: Cush, Egypt, Put, and Canaan.
Vana va Kuxi hi lava: Seba, na Havhila, na Sabita, na Rhama, na Sabiteka. Vana va Rhama hi lava: Xeba na Dedani.	The sons of Cush: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. The sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan.
Kuxi ú velekile Nimrodo, yena loyi a nga va nhenha yo sungula laha misaveni.	Cush fathered Nimrod; he was the first on earth to be a mighty man.
Emahlweni ka HOSI Xikwembu, Nimrodo a a tiveka a ri muhloti lonkulu. Hikokwalaho ku hume xivuriso lexi nge: Ú fana na Nimrodo, muhloti lonkulu emahlweni ka HOSI Xikwembu.	He was a mighty hunter before the LORD. Therefore it is said, Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before the LORD.
Loko Nimrodo a sungula ku fuma, a a fuma miti leyi: Babele, na Ereke, na Akade, hinkwayo yi ri etikweni ra Xinara.	The beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.
Ú suke laha tikweni leri, a ya le Asiriya a fika a aka miti leyi: Ninivha, na Rehoboto-Ira, na Kala	From that land he went into Assyria and built Nineveh, Rehoboth-Ir, Calah, and
ni muti wa Resene lowu nga xikarhi ka Ninivha ni muti lowukulu wa Kala.	Resen between Nineveh and Calah; that is the great city.
Egipta ú velekile vana lava: Ludu, na Anamu, na Lehaba, na Nafetuhi	Egypt fathered Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim
na Patroso, na Kasiluhi, na Kafitoro, yena kokwa wa Vafilista.	Pathrusim, Casluhim (from whom the Philistines came), and Caphtorim.
Kanana a veleka Sidoni mativula ya yena, a veleka na Heti.	Canaan fathered Sidon his firstborn and Heth
Kanana hi yena tata wa Vayebusi, ni Vaamori, ni Vagirigaxi	and the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites
ni Vahivhi, ni Vaariki, ni Vasini	the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites
ni Vaarivhada, ni Vasemari, ni Vahamata. Kutani va ka Kanana va sungula ku hangalaka ni matiko	the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites. Afterward the clans of the Canaanites dispersed.
ndzilekana wa tiko ra vona wu sungula eSidoni wu kongoma eGerara, wu ya fika eGaza; kutani wu jika wu kongoma etlhelo ra Sodoma na Gomora, na Adama, na Seboyimi, wu ya helela eLaxa.	And the territory of the Canaanites extended from Sidon in the direction of Gerar as far as Gaza, and in the direction of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha.
Lava hi vona vana va Hamu, lava tshameke ematikweni ya vona, va vulavula tindzimi to hambana-hambana hi ku ya hi tinxaka ta vona.	These are the sons of Ham, by their clans, their languages, their lands, and their nations.
Xeme, yena hosi ya Yafeta, kokwa wa va ka Ebere hinkwavo, ú velekile vana lava	To Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the elder brother of Japheth, children were born.
Elamu, na Axuru, na Aripakixada, na Ludi, na Aramu.	The sons of Shem: Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram.
Vana va Aramu hi lava: Usi, na Hulu, na Getere, na Maxa.	The sons of Aram: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.
Aripakixada ú velekile Xela, kutani Xela a veleka Ebere	Arpachshad fathered Shelah; and Shelah fathered Eber.
Ebere a veleka vana vambirhi: Un'wana vito ra yena a a ri Pelege (hileswaku ku avana, hikuva enkarhini wa yena matiko ma avene). Makwavo wa yena a a ri Yokotani.	To Eber were born two sons: the name of the one was Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided, and his brother's name was Joktan.
Yokotani ú velekile Alimodada, na Xelefi, na Hasari-Mavheti, na Yera	Joktan fathered Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah
na Hadorama, na Uzala, na Dikila	Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah
na Obala, na Abimaele, na Xeba	Obal, Abimael, Sheba
na Ufira, na Havhila, na Yobabu. Lava hinkwavo hi vona vana va Yokotani.	Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab; all these were the sons of Joktan.
Tiko leri a va tshama eka rona a ri sukela eMexa, ri ya fika eSefara, emagangeni ya le vuxeni.	The territory in which they lived extended from Mesha in the direction of Sephar to the hill country of the east.
Lava hi vona vana va Xeme lava tshamaka ematikweni ya vona va vulavula tindzimi to hambana-hambana, hi ku ya hi tinxaka ta vona.	These are the sons of Shem, by their clans, their languages, their lands, and their nations.
Lava hi vona vatukulu va Nowa hi ku ya hi mindyangu ya vona ni matiko ya vona. Ematikweni lawa, ku humile vanhu lava hangalakeke emisaveni, endzhaku ka ndhambi ya mati.	These are the clans of the sons of Noah, according to their genealogies, in their nations, and from these the nations spread abroad on the earth after the flood.
Khale vanhu hinkwavo emisaveni a va vulavula ririmi rin'we, leri a ri ri ni marito yo fana.	Now the whole earth had one language and the same words.
Loko va ri karhi va tsendzeleka evuxeni, va kumile rivala etikweni ra Xinara, kutani va aka kona.	And as people migrated from the east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there.
Kutani va byelana va ku: Tanani, a hi endleni switina, hi tlhela hi swi hisa swinene. Kutani ematshan'weni ya maribye va tirhisa switina, va swi khomanisa hi ntita.	And they said to one another, Come, let us make bricks, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and bitumen for mortar.
Kutani va ku: A hi tiakeleni muti, hi aka ni xihondzo lexi nga ta dliva tilo, leswaku hi ta tiveka, hi ta ka hi nga hangalasiwi emisaveni.	Then they said, Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be dispersed over the face of the whole earth.
Hiloko HOSI Xikwembu xi rhelela xi ta vona muti ni xihondzo lexi vanhu va tiakeleke xona	And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of man had built.
kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku: Vanhu lava i van'we, naswona va vulavula ririmi rin'we; kutani lawa mo va masungulo ya leswi va nga ta swi endla. Xin'wana ni xin'wana lexi va nga ta lava ku xi endla, xi nge va tsandzi.	And the LORD said, Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language, and this is only the beginning of what they will do. And nothing that they propose to do will now be impossible for them.
A hi rheleleni, hi ya pfilunganyisa ririmi ra vona, leswaku va ta ka va nga ha twanani loko va vulavula.	Come, let us go down and there confuse their language, so that they may not understand one another's speech.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi va hangalasa va suka emutini lowu, va ya emisaveni hinkwayo, va tshika ku aka muti.	So the LORD dispersed them from there over the face of all the earth, and they left off building the city.
Hiloko muti wa kona wu thyiwa vito ra Babele, hikuva HOSI Xikwembu xi pfilunganyisele kona ririmi ra vanhu va misava hinkwayo, xi va hangalasa va ya emisaveni hinkwayo.	Therefore its name was called Babel, because there the LORD confused the language of all the earth. And from there the LORD dispersed them over the face of all the earth.
Lava i vatukulu va Xeme. Loko ku hundzile malembe mambirhi endzhaku ka ndhambi ya mati, Xeme a a ri ni malembe ya 100, kutani a veleka Aripakixada.	These are the generations of Shem. When Shem was 100 years old, he fathered Arpachshad two years after the flood.
Endzhaku ka loko Xeme a velekile Aripakixada, ú hanyile malembe ya 500. Ú vile ni van'wana vana va xinuna ni va xisati.	And Shem lived after he fathered Arpachshad 500 years and had other sons and daughters.
Loko Aripakixada a ri ni malembe ya 35, a veleka Xela.	When Arpachshad had lived 35 years, he fathered Shelah.
Endzhaku ka loko Aripakixada a velekile Xela, ú hanyile malembe ya 403. Ú vile ni van'wana vana va xinuna ni va xisati.	And Arpachshad lived after he fathered Shelah 403 years and had other sons and daughters.
Loko Xela a ri ni malembe ya 30, a veleka Ebhere.	When Shelah had lived 30 years, he fathered Eber.
Endzhaku ka loko Xela a velekile Ebere, ú hanyile malembe ya 403. Ú vile ni van'wana vana va xinuna ni va xisati.	And Shelah lived after he fathered Eber 403 years and had other sons and daughters.
Loko Ebere a ri ni malembe ya 34, a veleka Pelege.	When Eber had lived 34 years, he fathered Peleg.
Endzhaku ka loko Ebere a velekile Pelege, ú hanyile malembe ya 430. Ú vile ni van'wana vana va xinuna ni va xisati.	And Eber lived after he fathered Peleg 430 years and had other sons and daughters.
Loko Pelege a ri ni malembe ya 30, a veleka Rhewu.	When Peleg had lived 30 years, he fathered Reu.
Endzhaku ka loko Pelege a velekile Rhewu, ú hanyile malembe ya 209. Ú vile ni van'wana vana va xinuna ni va xisati.	And Peleg lived after he fathered Reu 209 years and had other sons and daughters.
Loko Rhewu a ri ni malembe ya 32, a veleka Serugi.	When Reu had lived 32 years, he fathered Serug.
Endzhaku ka loko Rhewu a velekile Serugi, ú hanyile malembe ya 207. Ú vile ni van'wana vana va xinuna ni va xisati.	And Reu lived after he fathered Serug 207 years and had other sons and daughters.
Loko Serugi a ri ni malembe ya 30, a veleka Nahoro.	When Serug had lived 30 years, he fathered Nahor.
Endzhaku ka loko Serugi a velekile Nahoro, ú hanyile malembe ya 200. Ú vile ni van'wana vana va xinuna ni va xisati.	And Serug lived after he fathered Nahor 200 years and had other sons and daughters.
Loko Nahoro a ri ni malembe ya 29, a veleka Tera.	When Nahor had lived 29 years, he fathered Terah.
Endzhaku ka loko Nahoro a velekile Tera, ú hanyile malembe ya 119. Ú vile ni van'wana vana va xinuna ni va xisati.	And Nahor lived after he fathered Terah 119 years and had other sons and daughters.
Loko Tera a ri ni malembe ya 70, a veleka Abrama, na Nahoro, na Harana.	When Terah had lived 70 years, he fathered Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
Lava hi vona va ka Tera. Tera a a ri tata wa Abrama, na Nahoro, na Harana; kutani Harana a veleka Lota.	Now these are the generations of Terah. Terah fathered Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran fathered Lot.
Harana ú lovile tata wa yena Tera a ha hanya, a lovela emutini wa Uru, etikweni ra Vakalediya leri a velekeriweke eka rona.	Haran died in the presence of his father Terah in the land of his kindred, in Ur of the Chaldeans.
Abrama na Nahoro va teka vasati; nsati wa Abrama a a ri Sarayi, nsati wa Nahoro yena a a ri Milika, N'wa-Harana; makwavo wa Milika N'wa-Harana a a ri Yisika.	And Abram and Nahor took wives. The name of Abram's wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran the father of Milcah and Iscah.
Sarayi a a ri mhika, a nga kumi vana.	Now Sarai was barren; she had no child.
Kutani Tera a teka n'wana wa yena Abrama, ni ntukulu wa yena Lota n'wana Harana, ni n'wingi wa yena Sarayi nkata Abrama, va rhurha emutini wa Uru etikweni ra Vakalediya, va kongoma etikweni ra Kanana, kambe loko va fika emutini wa Harana, vo aka va tshama kona.	Terah took Abram his son and Lot the son of Haran, his grandson, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife, and they went forth together from Ur of the Chaldeans to go into the land of Canaan, but when they came to Haran, they settled there.
Tera ú hanyile malembe ya 205, kutani a lovela emutini wa Harana.	The days of Terah were 205 years, and Terah died in Haran.
HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Abrama: Suka etikweni ra rikwenu, u hambana ni maxaka ya wena ni va ka n'wina hinkwavo, u ya etikweni leri ndzi nga ta ku komba rona.	Now the LORD said to Abram, Go from your country and your kindred and your father's house to the land that I will show you.
Kutani ndzi ta ku endla tiko lerikulu, ndzi ku katekisa, ndzi kurisa vito ra wena; u ta va xihlovo xa minkateko.	And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing.
Ndzi ta katekisa lava va ku katekisaka, kambe loyi a ku rhuketelaka ndzi ta n'wi rhuketela. Kutani vanhu hinkwavo laha misaveni va ta katekisiwa hikwalaho ka wena.	I will bless those who bless you, and him who dishonors you I will curse, and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed.
Hiloko Abrama a suka a famba hilaha HOSI Xikwembu xi n'wi leriseke hakona; kutani Lota a famba na yena. Loko Abrama a suka eHarani a a ri ni malembe ya 75.	So Abram went, as the LORD had told him, and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran.
Kutani Abrama a teka Sarayi nsati wa yena, na Lota n'wana wa makwavo, ni swilo swa vona hinkwaswo, a teka ni malandza lawa va ma kumeke eHarani, va khoma ndlela va kongoma etikweni ra Kanana.	And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their possessions that they had gathered, and the people that they had acquired in Haran, and they set out to go to the land of Canaan. When they came to the land of Canaan
Loko va fika eKanana, Abrama a rhendzeleka na tiko a kondza a ya fika eka Nkuhlu wa More, yi nga ndhawu leyi nga Xikeme. Enkarhini lowu, Vakanana a va ha tshama etikweni leri.	Abram passed through the land to the place at Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. At that time the Canaanites were in the land.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi humelela eka Abrama xi ku ka yena: Tiko leri, ndzi ta ri nyika vatukulu va wena. Hiloko Abrama a aka alitari, a akela HOSI Xikwembu lexi humeleleke eka yena.	Then the LORD appeared to Abram and said, To your offspring I will give this land. So he built there an altar to the LORD, who had appeared to him.
Kutani Abrama a suka kwalaho a ya entshaveni leyi yi nga vuxeni bya muti wa Betele, a fika a dzima ntsonga kona. Hi tlhelo ra vupeladyambu a ku ri ni muti wa Betele, kasi evuxeni a ku ri ni muti wa Ayi. Kutani Abrama a akela HOSI Xikwembu alitari, a xi gandzela kona.	From there he moved to the hill country on the east of Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. And there he built an altar to the LORD and called upon the name of the LORD.
Kutani Abrama a ya emahlweni ni riendzo ra yena ro ya edzongeni.	And Abram journeyed on, still going toward the Negeb.
Loko ku hundzile nkarhi, ku wa ndlala etikweni ra Kanana. Kutani Abrama a rhelela etikweni ra Egipta ku ya luvela kona, hikuva ndlala a yi ri yikulu etikweni.	Now there was a famine in the land. So Abram went down to Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine was severe in the land.
Loko Abrama a lava ku nghena etikweni ra Egipta, a byela nsati wa yena Sarayi a ku: Ndza swi tiva leswaku u mbhuri ya wansati	When he was about to enter Egypt, he said to Sarai his wife, I know that you are a woman beautiful in appearance
hikokwalaho, loko Vaegipta va ku vona va ta ku: ‘Loyi, o va nsati wa yena’, kutani mina va ta ndzi dlaya, va siya wena.	and when the Egyptians see you, they will say, 'This is his wife.' Then they will kill me, but they will let you live.
Ku endlela leswaku va ta ndzi tsakela, va byele leswaku u makwerhu, kutani hikwalaho ka wena, va nge ndzi dlayi.	Say you are my sister, that it may go well with me because of you, and that my life may be spared for your sake.
Kunene loko Abrama a nghena etikweni, Vaegipta va swi vonile leswaku Sarayi i mbhuri ya wansati.	When Abram entered Egypt, the Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful.
Tindhuna tona ti lo na n'wi vona, to ya ti ya n'wi bumabumela eka Faro, kutani Sarayi a tekiwa a yisiwa endlwini ya Faro.	And when the princes of Pharaoh saw her, they praised her to Pharaoh. And the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
Kutani hikwalaho ka Sarayi Faro a tsakela Abrama, a n'wi nyika ni tinyimpfu, ni tihomu, ni timbhongolo ta xinuna ni ta mantswele, ni malandza ya xinuna ni ya xisati, ni tikamela.	And for her sake he dealt well with Abram; and he had sheep, oxen, male donkeys, male servants, female servants, female donkeys, and camels.
Kambe HOSI Xikwembu xi rhumela makhombo layo tala, xi ba Faro ni ndyangu wa yena hikwalaho ka Sarayi nkata Abrama.	But the LORD afflicted Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram's wife.
Kutani Faro a vitana Abrama a ku ka yena: Xana i mhaka muni leyi u ndzi vangeleke yona xana? Xana hikwalaho ka yini u nga ndzi byelanga leswaku munhu loyi i nsati wa wena xana?	So Pharaoh called Abram and said, What is this you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife?
U ndzi byerile leswaku i makwenu, kutani mina ndzi n'wi tekile ndzi n'wi endla nsati; xana a wu ndzi xisele yini xana? Kutani sweswi, nsati wa wena hi loyi, n'wi teke, u huma laha tikweni u famba.	Why did you say, 'She is my sister,' so that I took her for my wife? Now then, here is your wife; take her, and go.
Faro a lerisa malandza ya yena leswi ma nga ta endla Abrama swona, kutani wona ma n'wi teka ma n'wi humesa etikweni, a ri ni nsati wa yena ni swilo swa yena hinkwaswo.	And Pharaoh gave men orders concerning him, and they sent him away with his wife and all that he had.
Hiloko Abrama a tlhandluka a huma etikweni ra Egipta, a ri ni nsati wa yena ni swilo swa yena hinkwaswo; Lota a famba na vona va kongoma edzongeni ra tiko ra Kanana.	So Abram went up from Egypt, he and his wife and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the Negeb.
Enkarhini lowu, Abrama a a fumile swinene: A a ri ni tihomu, ni silivhere ni nsuku.	Now Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold.
Loko a suka edzongeni, Abrama ú yile emahlweni ni riendzo ra yena a kongoma eBetele, ku kondza a ya fika endhawini leyi a a tidzimerile ntsonga eka yona eku sunguleni, leyi yi nga xikarhi ka muti wa Betele ni muti wa Ayi.	And he journeyed on from the Negeb as far as Bethel to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai
Endhawini leyi, hi kona laha Abrama a a akile kona alitari eku sunguleni, a gandzela HOSI Xikwembu.	to the place where he had made an altar at the first. And there Abram called upon the name of the LORD.
Lota, loyi a a famba na Abrama, na yena a a ri ni mintlhambi ya swifuwo leswikulu ni leswitsongo, a tlhela a va ni mintsonga	And Lot, who went with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents
kutani ndhawu leyi a va ri eka yona, a yi nga ta kota ku va nyika swakudya swo ringana loko va tshama eka yona va ri vambirhi, naswona a va ri ni swilo swo tala, hikokwalaho a va nga ta tshama endhawini yin'we.	so that the land could not support both of them dwelling together; for their possessions were so great that they could not dwell together
Tlhandlakambirhi, a ku ri ni ku holova exikarhi ka varisi va swifuwo swa Abrama ni varisi va swifuwo swa Lota. Enkarhini lowu, Vakanana ni Vaperesi a va ha tshama etikweni leri.	and there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram's livestock and the herdsmen of Lot's livestock. At that time the Canaanites and the Perizzites were dwelling in the land.
Hiloko Abrama a ku ka Lota: Ku nga tshuki ku va ni ku holova exikarhi ka mina na wena, hambi ku ri exikarhi ka varisi va swifuwo swa mina ni varisi va swifuwo swa wena, hikuva hi vanhu van'we.	Then Abram said to Lot, Let there be no strife between you and me, and between your herdsmen and my herdsmen, for we are kinsmen.
Loko ri ri tiko, wa ri vona hinkwaro hi leri, kutani xana swi nge antswi loko ho hambana xana? Loko u hlawula ku ya eximatsini, mina ndzi ta ya exineneni, kasi loko u hlawula ku ya exineneni, mina ndzi ta ya eximatsini.	Is not the whole land before you? Separate yourself from me. If you take the left hand, then I will go to the right, or if you take the right hand, then I will go to the left.
Kutani Lota a tlakusa mahlo, a vona leswaku tindhawu ta le nkoveni wa Yordani, ni ku ya fika eSowara, ti ni mati yo tala ku fana ni ntanga wa HOSI Xikwembu, ni tiko ra Egipta. (Enkarhini lowu, HOSI Xikwembu a xi nga si herisa muti wa Sodoma ni muti wa Gomora.)	And Lot lifted up his eyes and saw that the Jordan Valley was well watered everywhere like the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, in the direction of Zoar. (This was before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.)
Hikokwalaho, Lota a tihlawulela tindhawu hinkwato ta Nkova wa Yordani, a famba a kongoma evuxeni; kutani Abrama na Lota va hambanisa sweswo.	So Lot chose for himself all the Jordan Valley, and Lot journeyed east. Thus they separated from each other.
Abrama a tshama etikweni ra Kanana, kasi Lota yena a ya tshama emitini leyi nga nkoveni, kambe hi kutsongo-tsongo a a tshineta ntsonga wa yena kusuhi na Sodoma	Abram settled in the land of Canaan, while Lot settled among the cities of the valley and moved his tent as far as Sodom.
wu nga muti wa vanhu vo homboloka, lava a va dyohela ngopfu HOSI Xikwembu.	Now the men of Sodom were wicked, great sinners against the LORD.
Kuteloko Lota a hambanile na Abrama, HOSI yi ku ka Abrama: Tlakusa mahlo, u languta en'walungwini, ni le dzongeni, ni le vuxeni, ni le vupeladyambu ku sukela kwala u nga kona	The LORD said to Abram, after Lot had separated from him, Lift up your eyes and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward
hikuva tiko hinkwaro leri u ri vonaka, ndzi ta ku nyika rona, ri va ra wena ni vatukulu va wena hilaha ku nga heriki.	for all the land that you see I will give to you and to your offspring forever.
Ndzi ta endla leswaku vatukulu va wena va tala ku fana ni ntshuri wa misava, kutani a ku nga vi na munhu loyi a nga ta kota ku va hlaya, hikuva ntshuri wa misava a wu hlayeki.	I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth, so that if one can count the dust of the earth, your offspring also can be counted.
Suka u famba u rhendzeleka ni tiko leri hinkwaro, u kondza u ri hlanganisa, hikuva ndzi ta ku nyika rona.	Arise, walk through the length and the breadth of the land, for I will give it to you.
Kutani Abrama a rhurhisa ntsonga wa yena, a ya tshama eka Minkuhlu ya Mamre le Hebroni; kutani a akela HOSI Xikwembu alitari kona.	So Abram moved his tent and came and settled by the oaks of Mamre, which are at Hebron, and there he built an altar to the LORD.
Amirafele hosi ya Xinara, na Ariyoko hosi ya Elasara, na Kedoro-Lawomere hosi ya Elamu, na Tidala hosi ya Goyimi	In the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim
va huma nyimpi va ya lwa na Bera hosi ya Sodoma, na Birixa hosi ya Gomora, na Xinabu hosi ya Adama, na Xemebere hosi ya Seboyimi, na hosi ya Bela (wu nga muti wa Sowara).	these kings made war with Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar).
Kutani tihosi leti hinkwato ti yima swin'we ti ya hlengeletana eka Nkova wa Sidimi (ri nga Lwandle-ra-ku-fa).	And all these joined forces in the Valley of Siddim (that is, the Salt Sea).
Tihosi leti, ti vile ehansi ka Kedoro-Lawomere ku ringana malembe ya 12, kutani hi lembe ra vu-13 ti sungula ku n'wi hundzukela.	Twelve years they had served Chedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
Hi lembe ra vu-14, Kedoro-Lawomere ni tihosi leti a ti yima na yena, va hlula muti wa Refayimi le Axiteroti-Karnayimi, ni muti wa Suzimi eHamu, ni muti wa Emini eXave-Kiriyatayimi	In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him came and defeated the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, the Zuzim in Ham, the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim
va hlula ni Vahori lava tshamaka entshaveni ya vona ya Seyira, ku kondza va ya fika le Eliparani, laha mananga ma sungulaka kona.	and the Horites in their hill country of Seir as far as El-paran on the border of the wilderness.
Kutani va hundzuluka va ya fika le Eni-Mixipati (hileswaku Kadexe), va hlasela tiko hinkwaro ra Vaamaleke, ni ra Vaamori lava a va tshama eHasasoni-Tamara.	Then they turned back and came to En-mishpat (that is, Kadesh) and defeated all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites who were dwelling in Hazazon-tamar.
Kutani hosi ya Sodoma, ni ya Gomora, ni ya Adama, ni ya Seboyimi, ni ya Bela (ku nga muti wa Sowara), ti huma nyimpi ti ya hlengeletana eka Nkova wa Sidimi	Then the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar) went out, and they joined battle in the Valley of Siddim
ti lwa na Kedoro-Lawomere hosi ya Elamu, na Tidala hosi ya Goyimi, na Amirafele hosi ya Xinara, na Ariyoko hosi ya Elasara, kutani tihosi leti ta mune ti yima swin'we ti lwa ni tihosi leta ntlhanu.	with Chedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of Goiim, Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar, four kings against five.
Nkova wa Sidimi a wu ri ni makhele-khele lama taleke hi ntinta, kutani tihosi tin'wana ta Sodoma na Gomora ti wela eka wona loko ti ri karhi ti tsutsuma; leti poneke tona ti tsutsumerile etintshaveni.	Now the Valley of Siddim was full of bitumen pits, and as the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some fell into them, and the rest fled to the hill country.
Kutani valala va teka swilo hinkwaswo swa Sodoma na Gomora, va teka ni swakudya hinkwaswo va famba na swona.	So the enemy took all the possessions of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their provisions, and went their way.
Lota n'wana makwavo wa Abrama a a tshama eSodoma, kutani va n'wi khoma va famba na yena ni swilo swa yena hinkwaswo.	They also took Lot, the son of Abram's brother, who was dwelling in Sodom, and his possessions, and went their way.
Munhu un'wana loyi a poneke enyimpini, ú yile a ya byela Abrama lowa Muheveru leswi humeleleke. Abrama a a tshama eminkuhlwini ya ka Mamre lowa Muamori, makwavo wa Exikolo na Anere, lava a va yima na Abrama.	Then one who had escaped came and told Abram the Hebrew, who was living by the oaks of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and of Aner. These were allies of Abram.
Kuteloko Abrama a twa leswaku va khomile Lota n'wana wa makwavo va famba na yena, a vitana tinhenha ta 318 leti a ti ri emutini wa yena, va hlongorisa valala ku kondza va ya fika eDani	When Abram heard that his kinsman had been taken captive, he led forth his trained men, born in his house, 318 of them, and went in pursuit as far as Dan.
kutani Abrama a avanyisa malandza ya yena hi mintlawa-ntlawa, va hlasela valala va vona nivusiku, va va hlongorisa ku kondza va ya fika eHoba, en'walungwini wa muti wa Damaska.	And he divided his forces against them by night, he and his servants, and defeated them and pursued them to Hobah, north of Damascus.
Kutani Abrama a va tekela swilo hinkwaswo leswi va swi phangheke, a teka na Lota n'wana wa makwavo, ni swilo swa yena, ni vavasati, ni vanhu lava a va va khomile.	Then he brought back all the possessions, and also brought back his kinsman Lot with his possessions, and the women and the people.
Loko Abrama a vuya hi le ku hlaseleni ka Kedoro-Lawomere ni tihosi leti a ti yima na yena, hosi ya Sodoma yi humile yi ya n'wi hlanganisa eka Nkova-wa-Xavhe (hileswaku Nkova-wa-hosi).	After his return from the defeat of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, the king of Sodom went out to meet him at the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the King's Valley).
Kutani Melkisedeke hosi ya Salema a humesa xinkwa ni vhinyo. Melkisedeke a a ri muprista wa Xikwembu-xa-le-henhla-henhla.	And Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. (He was priest of God Most High.)
Hosi ya Sodoma yi ku ka Abrama: Ndzi kombela leswaku u ndzi tlherisela vanhu lava u va khomeke; kambe swilo leswi u nga na swona, u nga ha titekela swona swi va swa wena.	And the king of Sodom said to Abram, Give me the persons, but take the goods for yourself.
Kambe Abrama a hlamula hosi ya Sodoma a ku ka yona: Ndzi hlambanyile emahlweni ka HOSI Xikwembu-xa-le-henhla-henhla, xona muendli wa tilo ni misava	But Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lifted my hand to the LORD, God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth
leswaku ndzi nge pfuki ndzi tekile hambi yi ri njarha kumbe ngoti yo boha tintanghu, kumbe xilo xihi na xihi lexi nga xa wena, hikuva u nga ta ku: ‘Hi mina ndzi fumiseke Abrama.’	that I would not take a thread or a sandal strap or anything that is yours, lest you should say, 'I have made Abram rich.'
Hikokwalaho, mina ndzi nge amukeri nchumu, handle ka swakudya leswi majaha ma swi dyeke, ni swilo leswi nga ta averiwa lava a ndzi fambile na vona; kambe Anere na Exikolo na Mamre, vona a va averiwe swa vona.	I will take nothing but what the young men have eaten, and the share of the men who went with me. Let Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre take their share.
Endzhaku ka timhaka leti, HOSI Xikwembu xi tikomba eka Abrama hi ku vulavula na yena, xi ku: Abrama, u nga chavi, hikuva hi mina xitlhangu xa wena; u ta va ni minkateko leyo tala!	After these things the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision: Fear not, Abram, I am your shield; your reward shall be very great.
Kambe Abrama a hlamula a ku: We Xikwembu N'wini wanga, xana u to ndzi nyika yini, hikuva ku fikela sweswi a ndzi si va na n'wana, kutani loyi a nga ta dya ndzhaka ya mina i Eliezere wa le Damaska.	But Abram said, O Lord GOD, what will you give me, for I continue childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?
Abrama a engeta a ku: A wu ndzi nyikanga n'wana, kutani hlonga leri ri nga laha mutini wa mina, hi rona ri nga ta va mudyandzhaka.	And Abram said, Behold, you have given me no offspring, and a member of my household will be my heir.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Abrama: Munhu loyi Eliezere a hi yena la nga ta va mudyandzhaka ya wena, kambe n'wana wa wena wa xiviri hi yena la nga ta dya ndzhaka ya wena.	And behold, the word of the LORD came to him: This man shall not be your heir; your very own son shall be your heir.
Kavaloko HOSI Xikwembu xi teka Abrama xi ya na yena ehandle, kutani xi ku ka yena: Languta ehenhla u hlaya tinyeleti, u vona loko u nga ti hlaya u ti heta! Hiloko xi ku ka yena: Vatukulu va wena va ta tala ku fana ni tinyeleti leti.	And he brought him outside and said, Look toward heaven, and number the stars, if you are able to number them. Then he said to him, So shall your offspring be.
Abrama a tshemba marito ya HOSI Xikwembu, kutani hikwalaho ka swona sweswo, Xikwembu xi n'wi vona a ri munhu la lulameke.	And he believed the LORD, and he counted it to him as righteousness.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Abrama: Hi mina HOSI Xikwembu lexi xi ku humeseke emutini wa Uru etikweni ra Vakalediya, leswaku ndzi ta ku nyika tiko leri ri va ra wena.	And he said to him, I am the LORD who brought you out from Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to possess.
Abrama a hlamula a ku: We Xikwembu N'wini wanga, xana ndzi ta swi tivisa ku yini leswaku tiko leri ri ta va ra mina xana?	But he said, O Lord GOD, how am I to know that I shall possess it?
Kavaloko HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka yena: Ndzi tisele homu ya thokazi, ni mbuti ya thokazi, ni khuna, swifuwo leswi hinkwaswo swi va swa malembe manharhu, u tisa ni matuva mambirhi.	He said to him, Bring me a heifer three years old, a female goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.
Abrama a tisela HOSI Xikwembu swilo leswi hinkwaswo, kutani a swi pandza hi le xikarhi, a veka rihlanguti rin'we ri langutana ni lerin'wana; matuva wona a nga ma pandzanga.	And he brought him all these, cut them in half, and laid each half over against the other. But he did not cut the birds in half.
Loko ku ta makoti ma lava ku dya nyama leyi, Abrama a a ma hlongola.	And when birds of prey came down on the carcasses, Abram drove them away.
Loko dyambu ri ya eku peleni, Abrama a khomiwa hi vurhongo lebyikulu; kutani a tikuma a funengetiwile hi munyama lowukulu wo chavisa	As the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell on Abram. And behold, dreadful and great darkness fell upon him.
kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka yena: U fanele ku tshama u ri karhi u tiva mhaka leyi: Vatukulu va wena va ta va valuveri etikweni ra van'wana va hundzuka mahlonga kona, va xaniseka malembe yo ringana 400.	Then the LORD said to Abram, Know for certain that your offspring will be sojourners in a land that is not theirs and will be servants there, and they will be afflicted for four hundred years.
Kambe mina ndzi ta ba tiko leri va nga ta va mahlonga eka rona, kutani va ta huma kona va fumile swinene.	But I will bring judgment on the nation that they serve, and afterward they shall come out with great possessions.
Loko a ri wena, u ta tietlelela u dyuharile swinene, u landza vatata wa wena hi ku rhula.	As for you, you shall go to your fathers in peace; you shall be buried in a good old age.
Kambe vatukulu-xinguwe va wena va ta tlhela va vuya etikweni leri, hikuva sweswi vubihi bya Vaamori a byi si fika emakumu ka byona.	And they shall come back here in the fourth generation, for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete.
Loko dyambu ri perile, ku va ni xinyami lexikulu, kutani ku humelela mbita leyi tuvikaka musi, ni xisana xa ndzilo, swi hundza hi le xikarhi ka nyama leyi veketeriweke.	When the sun had gone down and it was dark, behold, a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch passed between these pieces.
Hi siku rero, HOSI Xikwembu xi endla ntwanano na Abrama, xi ku ka yena: Tiko leri, ndzi ta ri nyika vatukulu va wena, ku sukela endzilekaneni wa tiko ra Egipta ku ya fika enambyeni lowukulu wa Yufrata	On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, To your offspring I give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates
ri nga tiko ra Vakeni, ni Vakenizi, ni Vakadimoni	the land of the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites
ni Vahiti, ni Vaperesi, ni Varefayimi	the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim
ni Vaamori, ni Vakanana, ni Vagirigaxi, ni Vayebusi.	the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites and the Jebusites.
Enkarhini lowu, Sarayi nkata Abrama a a nga si va na n'wana, kambe a a ri ni nandza wa xisati wa Muegipta, loyi a va ku i Hagara.	Now Sarai, Abram's wife, had borne him no children. She had a female Egyptian servant whose name was Hagar.
Kutani Sarayi a ku ka Abrama: Vona, HOSI yi ndzi tsonile vana, kutani wena yana u ya tivana ni nandza wa mina, kumbexana yena a nga ndzi velekela vana. Abrama a nkhensa marito ya Sarayi	And Sarai said to Abram, Behold now, the LORD has prevented me from bearing children. Go in to my servant; it may be that I shall obtain children by her. And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.
kutani Sarayi nkata Abrama a teka Hagara, nandza wa yena lowa Muegipta, a n'wi nyiketa eka Abrama leswaku a va nsati wa yena. Leswi swi humelerile loko Abrama a hetile khume ra malembe a ri etikweni ra Kanana.	So, after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her servant, and gave her to Abram her husband as a wife.
Hiloko Abrama a ya tivana na Hagara, kutani Hagara a tika. Loko Hagara a vona leswaku ú tikile, a sungula ku langutela n'wini wa yena Sarayi ehansi.	And he went in to Hagar, and she conceived. And when she saw that she had conceived, she looked with contempt on her mistress.
Kutani Sarayi a ku ka Abrama: Hi wena u faneleke ku vona mhaka ya ku xanisiwa ka mina! Ndzi nyiketile Hagara eka wena, kambe ú lo na vona leswaku ú tikile, o sungula ku ndzi langutela hansi. HOSI Xikwembu a xi ve xona xi avanyisaka mhaka ya kona.	And Sarai said to Abram, May the wrong done to me be on you! I gave my servant to your embrace, and when she saw that she had conceived, she looked on me with contempt. May the LORD judge between you and me!
Kutani Abrama a hlamula Sarayi a ku: Nandza loyi wa wena, ú lawuriwa hi wena, vona leswi u nga endlaka swona hi yena. Kavaloko Sarayi a sungula ku khoma Hagara hi ndlela ya tihanyi, Hagara a kondza a baleka a hambana na yena.	But Abram said to Sarai, Behold, your servant is in your power; do to her as you please. Then Sarai dealt harshly with her, and she fled from her.
Loko Hagara a ri exihlobyeni lexi nga mananga, endleleni yo ya eXuru, a kumiwa hi ntsumi ya HOSI Xikwembu	The angel of the LORD found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, the spring on the way to Shur.
kutani ntsumi yi ku ka yena: Hagara nandza wa Sarayi, u ta u huma kwihi, naswona u ya kwihi xana? Hagara a hlamula a ku: Ndzi balekile hi ku chava Sarayi n'wini wa mina.	And he said, Hagar, servant of Sarai, where have you come from and where are you going? She said, I am fleeing from my mistress Sarai.
Ntsumi ya HOSI Xikwembu yi ku ka yena: Tlhelela eka n'wini wa wena, u hamba u titsongahata eka yena.	The angel of the LORD said to her, Return to your mistress and submit to her.
Ntsumi ya HOSI Xikwembu yi ya emahlweni yi ku ka yena: Ndzi ta ku nyika vatukulu lavo tala, lero a ku nga vi na munhu loyi a nga ta kota ku va hlaya a va heta.	The angel of the LORD also said to her, I will surely multiply your offspring so that they cannot be numbered for multitude.
Kutani Hagara a thya HOSI Xikwembu lexi vulavuleke na yena evito ra Xikwembu-lexi-voniwaka, hikuva a a ku: Xana ndzi nga va ndzi vonile Xikwembu hakunene, ndzi tama ndza ha hanya xana?	So she called the name of the LORD who spoke to her, You are a God of seeing, for she said, Truly here I have seen him who looks after me.
Hikokwalaho, xihlovo lexi xi thyiwile vito ra Berilahayi-Royi (hileswaku Xihlovo-xa-loyi-a-vonaka-a-tlhela-a-hanya). Xihlovo lexi xi le xikarhi ka muti wa Kadexe ni wa Berede.	Therefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; it lies between Kadesh and Bered.
Hagara a veleka n'wana wa mufana, kutani Abrama a thya n'wana loyi wa yena evito ra Iximaele.	And Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael.
Loko Hagara a kuma n'wana, Abrama a a ri ni malembe ya 86.	Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.
Loko Abrama a ri ni malembe ya 99, HOSI Xikwembu xi humelela eka yena, xi ku: Hi mina Xikwembu-xa-matimba-hinkwawo; u fanele ku hanya emahlweni ka mina, u ndzi yingisa hi ku hetiseka.	When Abram was ninety-nine years old the LORD appeared to Abram and said to him, I am God Almighty; walk before me, and be blameless
Ndzi ta endla ntwanano exikarhi ka mina na wena, naswona ndzi ta ku nyika vatukulu lavo tala ngopfu.	that I may make my covenant between me and you, and may multiply you greatly.
Hiloko Abrama a wela ehansi hi mombo, kutani Xikwembu xi ku ka yena	Then Abram fell on his face. And God said to him
Vona, ndzi ta endla ntwanano na wena: Hi wena u nga ta va tata wa vanhu va matiko layo tala.	Behold, my covenant is with you, and you shall be the father of a multitude of nations.
Vito ra wena a ri nga ha vi Abrama, kambe ri ta va Abrahama, hikuva ndzi ku endla tata wa vanhu va matiko layo tala.	No longer shall your name be called Abram, but your name shall be Abraham, for I have made you the father of a multitude of nations.
Ndzi ta endla leswaku u va ni vatukulu va ntsandza-vahlayi; eka wena ndzi ta humesa vanhu va matiko layo tala; hambi ti ri tihosi ti ta huma eka wena.	I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will make you into nations, and kings shall come from you.
Ndzi ta endla ntwanano exikarhi ka mina na wena, ni vatukulu va wena lava nga ta sala va hanya endzhaku ka wena; ntwanano lowu wu ta va kona hilaha ku nga heriki, kutani ndzi ta va Xikwembu xa wena ni xa vatukulu va wena.	And I will establish my covenant between me and you and your offspring after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and to your offspring after you.
Tiko leri u luveleke eka rona, ri nga tiko ra Kanana, ndzi ta ku nyika rona hinkwaro, ri va ra wena ni vatukulu va wena hilaha ku nga heriki, kutani mina ndzi ta va Xikwembu xa vona.	And I will give to you and to your offspring after you the land of your sojournings, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession, and I will be their God.
Xikwembu xi ku ka Abrahama: Wena ni vatukulu va wena hinkwavo lava nga ta velekiwa, mi fanele ku hlayisa ntwanano wa mina.	And God said to Abraham, As for you, you shall keep my covenant, you and your offspring after you throughout their generations.
Ntwanano lowu mi faneleke ku wu hlayisa, lowu nga ta va kona exikarhi ka mina na wena, ni vatukulu va wena lava nga ta velekiwa, hi lowu: Munhu un'wana ni un'wana wa xinuna ú fanele ku yimbisiwa.	This is my covenant, which you shall keep, between me and you and your offspring after you: Every male among you shall be circumcised.
Mi ta yimbisiwa hi ku tsemiwa minsuvu, kutani xi ta va xikombiso xa ntwanano exikarhi ka mina na n'wina.	You shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskins, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and you.
Mi ta hamba mi yimbisa vana va n'wina va xinuna loko va ri ni masiku ya 8; mi ta yimbisa hinkwavo lava nga ta velekiwa, hambi ri ri hlonga leri nga lo velekeriwa exikarhi ka n'wina ntsena, kumbe leri mi nga lo ri xava eka vanhu vambe.	He who is eight days old among you shall be circumcised. Every male throughout your generations, whether born in your house or bought with your money from any foreigner who is not of your offspring
Mahlonga hinkwawo lama velekeriweke emitini ya n'wina kumbe lawa mi ma xaveke hi mali, ma fanele ku yimbisiwa. Hi ndlela leyi, mfungho wa ntwanano wa mina lowu nga heriki, wu ta va enyameni ya n'wina.	both he who is born in your house and he who is bought with your money, shall surely be circumcised. So shall my covenant be in your flesh an everlasting covenant.
Munhu un'wana ni un'wana wa xinuna loyi a nga yimbisiwangiki, ú ta hlongoriwa a suka exikarhi ka va ka vona, hikuva ú ta va a tshovile ntwanano wa mina.	Any uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin shall be cut off from his people; he has broken my covenant.
Kutani Xikwembu xi ku ka Abrahama: Sarayi nsati wa wena a nge he vitaniwi hi vito ra Sarayi, kambe ú ta va Sara.	And God said to Abraham, As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall be her name.
Ndzi ta n'wi katekisa, ndzi endla leswaku a ku velekela n'wana wa mufana. Ú ta va mana wa vanhu va matiko layo tala, a veleka ni tihosi, hikwalaho ka leswi ndzi n'wi katekiseke.	I will bless her, and moreover, I will give you a son by her. I will bless her, and she shall become nations; kings of peoples shall come from her.
Kutani Abrahama a wela hansi hi mombo, a ri karhi a hleka, a tivutisa a ku: Xana wanuna loyi a nga ni malembe ya 100, a nga ha tswala n'wana xana? Leswi Sara a nga ni malembe ya 90, a nga ha kuma n'wana xana?	Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed and said to himself, Shall a child be born to a man who is a hundred years old? Shall Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear a child?
Kutani Abrahama a ku ka Xikwembu: Onge u nga amukela Iximaele!	And Abraham said to God, Oh that Ishmael might live before you!
Xikwembu xi hlamula xi ku: E-e, Sara nsati wa wena ú ta ku velekela n'wana wa mufana, kutani wena u ta n'wi thya vito ra Isaka. Ndzi ta endla ntwanano na yena, wu va ntwanano lowu nga ta va kona hilaha ku nga heriki exikarhi ka mina ni vatukulu va yena lava nga ta velekiwa.	God said, No, but Sarah your wife shall bear you a son, and you shall call his name Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his offspring after him.
Loko xi ri xikombelo xa wena hi tlhelo ra Iximaele, ndzi xi twile; ndzi ta n'wi katekisa ndzi n'wi nyika vatukulu lavo tala swinene. Ndzi ta n'wi endla tiko lerikulu, a va tata wa tihosi ta 12.	As for Ishmael, I have heard you; behold, I have blessed him and will make him fruitful and multiply him greatly. He shall father twelve princes, and I will make him into a great nation.
Kambe ndzi ta endla ntwanano na Isaka, a nga n'wana loyi a nga ta velekiwa hi Sara lembe leri taka hi nguva leyi.	But I will establish my covenant with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear to you at this time next year.
Kuteloko Xikwembu xi hetile ku vulavula na Abrahama, xi tlhandluka xi hambana na yena.	When he had finished talking with him, God went up from Abraham.
Kutani Abrahama a teka n'wana wa yena Iximaele, ni mahlonga hinkwawo ya xinuna lama nga velekiwa emutini wa yena kumbe lama nga lo xaviwa hi mali, a ya va yimbisa ro siku rero hilaha Xikwembu xi n'wi leriseke hakona.	Then Abraham took Ishmael his son and all those born in his house or bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house, and he circumcised the flesh of their foreskins that very day, as God had said to him.
Loko Abrahama a yimbisiwa a a ri ni malembe ya 99	Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
kasi Iximaele n'wana wa yena ú yimbisiwile a ri ni malembe ya 13.	And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
Hi siku rero, Abrahama a yimbisiwa swin'we ni n'wana wa yena Iximaele	That very day Abraham and his son Ishmael were circumcised.
ni vavanuna hinkwavo va muti wa yena, ku katsa ni mahlonga lama velekiweke kona kumbe lama nga lo xaviwa hi mali ma huma eka vanhu vambe.	And all the men of his house, those born in the house and those bought with money from a foreigner, were circumcised with him.
Siku rin'wana ninhlekanhi, dyambu ri ri karhi ri hisa, HOSI Xikwembu xi humelela eka Abrahama le ka Minkuhlu ya Mamre, xi n'wi kuma a tshamile enyangweni ya ntsonga wa yena.	And the LORD appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat at the door of his tent in the heat of the day.
Loko Abrahama a tlakusa mahlo, o vona vavanuna vanharhu va yimile emahlweni ka yena; hiloko a suka enyangweni ya ntsonga wa yena hi ku tsutsuma, a ya va hlanganisa, a fika a korhama	He lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, three men were standing in front of him. When he saw them, he ran from the tent door to meet them and bowed himself to the earth
a ku: N'we vini vanga, loko mi ndzi tsakela, ndzi kombela leswaku mi yimanyana laha ka mina nandza wa n'wina.	and said, O Lord, if I have found favor in your sight, do not pass by your servant.
Mi nge ndzi ya mi lavela swimatana mi ta phumunha ritshuri emilengeni, mi wisanyana laha hansi ka murhi.	Let a little water be brought, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree
Leswi mi teke hi laha ka mina nandza wa n'wina, ndza ha ta sungula hi ku mi lavela vuswanyana mi ta miyeta nyoka, kutani hi kona mi nga ta ya emahlweni ni riendzo ra n'wina. Vona va hlamula va ku: Hiswona, endla hilaha u vulaka hakona.	while I bring a morsel of bread, that you may refresh yourselves, and after that you may pass on—since you have come to your servant. So they said, Do as you have said.
Kavaloko Abrahama a hatlisa a ya eka Sara entsongeni, a fika a ku: Hatla u teka swirhundzu swinharhu swa mapa lamanene, u ma pfuva u sweka swimbhundzwa.	And Abraham went quickly into the tent to Sarah and said, Quick! Three seahs of fine flour! Knead it, and make cakes.
Abrahama yena a tsutsuma a ya entlhambini, a fika a teka rhole ro saseka, ro nona, a ri yisa eka nandza wa yena, kutani nandza a ri tlhava.	And Abraham ran to the herd and took a calf, tender and good, and gave it to a young man, who prepared it quickly.
Kutani Abrahama a teka phehlwa ni ntswamba ni nyama ya rhole leyi a yi lulamiseke, a ya swi veka emahlweni ka vona ehansi ka murhi, a yima kwalaho tlhelo loko va ri karhi va dya.	Then he took curds and milk and the calf that he had prepared, and set it before them. And he stood by them under the tree while they ate.
Kutani va n'wi vutisa va ku: Ú kwihi Sara nsati wa wena xana? A hlamula a ku: Ú kwala ntsongeni.	They said to him, Where is Sarah your wife? And he said, She is in the tent.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku: Ndza ku tshembisa leswaku ndzi ta tlhela ndzi vuya kambe haxawu hi nkarhi wolowu; Sara nsati wa wena ú ta va a ri na n'wana wa mufana. Sara a a ri eku yingiseleni, a ri enyangweni ya ntsonga, a nga voniwi.	The LORD said, I will surely return to you about this time next year, and Sarah your wife shall have a son. And Sarah was listening at the tent door behind him.
Enkarhini lowu, Abrahama na Sara a va dyuharile swinene; Sara a a hundzeriwile hi nkarhi wa ku kuma vana.	Now Abraham and Sarah were old, advanced in years. The way of women had ceased to be with Sarah.
Hikokwalaho, Sara a hleka a tivutisa a ku: Xana xikoxa xo fana na mina xi nga ha tiphina xana? Tlhandlakambirhi, na yena nuna wa mina ú dyuharile!	So Sarah laughed to herself, saying, After I am worn out, and my lord is old, shall I have pleasure?
HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Abrahama: Xana Sara ú hleka yini, a vula leswaku ú hundzeriwile hi nkarhi wa ku kuma n'wana xana?	The LORD said to Abraham, Why did Sarah laugh and say, 'Shall I indeed bear a child, now that I am old?'
Xana xi kona lexi xi nga tsandzaka mina HOSI xana? Haxawu, hi nkarhi lowu ndzi wu vekeke, ndzi ta tlhela ndzi vuya eka wena; Sara ú ta va a ri na n'wana wa mufana.	Is anything too hard for the LORD? At the appointed time I will return to you, about this time next year, and Sarah shall have a son.
Sara a a chava, kutani a kaneta a ku: Mina a ndzi hlekanga. HOSI Xikwembu xi ku: Wa hemba, u hlekile.	But Sarah denied it, saying, I did not laugh, for she was afraid. He said, No, but you did laugh.
Kutani vavanuna lava va suka eka Abrahama va kongoma etlhelo ra muti wa Sodoma, kutani Abrahama a va heleketanyana.	Then the men set out from there, and they looked down toward Sodom. And Abraham went with them to set them on their way.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi tivutisa xi ku: Xana ndzi nga fihlela Abrahama leswi ndzi lavaka ku swi endla xana?	The LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do
E-e, hikuva Abrahama loyi ú ta va tiko lerikulu, kutani vanhu va matiko hinkwawo ya misava va ta katekisiwa hikwalaho ka yena.	seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
Ndzi n'wi hlawurile leswaku a letela vana va yena ni va ka vona hinkwavo lava nga ta velekiwa leswaku va famba etindleleni ta mina HOSI, va endla leswinene, swo lulama, kutani mina HOSI ndzi ta endlela Abrahama hinkwaswo leswi ndzi n'wi tshembiseke swona.	For I have chosen him, that he may command his children and his household after him to keep the way of the LORD by doing righteousness and justice, so that the LORD may bring to Abraham what he has promised him.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ya emahlweni xi ku: Swivilelo hi tlhelo ra muti wa Sodoma ni muti wa Gomora swi tele ngopfu, ni swidyoho swa vona swa chavisa	Then the LORD said, Because the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is great and their sin is very grave
hikokwalaho ndzi ta rhelela ndzi ya vona loko leswi ndzi swi twaka hi tlhelo ra vona va swi endlile hakunene. Loko swi ri swona, ndzi ta swi tiva.	I will go down to see whether they have done altogether according to the outcry that has come to me. And if not, I will know.
Kutani vavanuna volavo va hundzuluka va kongoma etlhelo ra muti wa Sodoma, kambe Abrahama yena a sala a yimile emahlweni ka HOSI Xikwembu.	So the men turned from there and went toward Sodom, but Abraham still stood before the LORD.
Kutani Abrahama a tshinela kusuhi na xona, a ku: Xana u tiyisile hakunene leswaku u ta herisa lavo lulama swin'we ni lavo homboloka xana?	Then Abraham drew near and said, Will you indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked?
A hi nge emutini ku ni vanhu vo lulama va 50, xana u nga wu herisa, u nga wu tsetseleli, hambiloko ku ri na vanhu lava vo lulama va 50 eka wona xana?	Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city. Will you then sweep away the place and not spare it for the fifty righteous who are in it?
Mhaka ya ku herisiwa ka vanhu vo lulama swin'we ni lavo homboloka, u nga tshuki u yi endla. U nga tshuki u fanisa lavo lulama ni lavo homboloka. Xana Muavanyisi wa misava hinkwayo a nga tsandzeka ku endla leswo lulama xana?	Far be it from you to do such a thing, to put the righteous to death with the wicked, so that the righteous fare as the wicked! Far be that from you! Shall not the Judge of all the earth do what is just?
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku: Loko ndzo kuma vanhu vo lulama va 50 emutini wa Sodoma, ndzi ta tsetselela muti lowu hinkwawo hikwalaho ka vona.	And the LORD said, If I find at Sodom fifty righteous in the city, I will spare the whole place for their sake.
Abrahama a hlamula a ku: Vona, ndzi kanyile mbilu ndzi ta ndzi ta vulavula na wena HOSI, hambileswi ndzi ngo va ntshuri ni nkuma ntsena.	Abraham answered and said, Behold, I have undertaken to speak to the Lord, I who am but dust and ashes.
Loko eka vanhu vo lulama va 50, ku kayivela ntlhanu ntsena, xana u nga kala u herisa muti hinkwawo hikwalaho ka ku kayivela ka vanhu va ntlhanu vo lulama xana? HOSI Xikwembu xi ku: Loko ndzo kuma vanhu vo lulama va 45 emutini, ndzi nge wu herisi.	Suppose five of the fifty righteous are lacking. Will you destroy the whole city for lack of five? And he said, I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there.
Kutani Abrahama a ya emahlweni a ku ka HOSI Xikwembu: A hi nge emutini ku kumeka vanhu vo lulama va 40 ntsena. HOSI Xikwembu xi hlamula xi ku: Hikwalaho ka vanhu va 40, ndzi nge wu herisi.	Again he spoke to him and said, Suppose forty are found there. He answered, For the sake of forty I will not do it.
Kutani Abrahama a ku: Ndzi kombela leswaku u nga hlundzuki, we HOSI, hikuva ndza ha lava ku vulavula. A hi nge emutini ku kumeka vanhu vo lulama va 30 ntsena. HOSI Xikwembu xi hlamula xi ku: Loko ndzo kuma vanhu vo lulama va 30, a ndzi nga wu herisi.	Then he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak. Suppose thirty are found there. He answered, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.
Abrahama a ku: Vona, ndzi kanyile mbilu ndzi ta ndzi ta vulavula na wena HOSI. A hi nge emutini wa kona ku kumeka vanhu vo lulama va 20. HOSI Xikwembu xi hlamula yi ku: Hikwalaho ka vanhu va 20, a ndzi nga wu herisi.	He said, Behold, I have undertaken to speak to the Lord. Suppose twenty are found there. He answered, For the sake of twenty I will not destroy it.
Kutani Abrahama a ku: Ndzi kombela leswaku u nga hlundzuki we HOSI, hikuva ndza ha lava ku vulavula kan'we ntsena. A hi nge emutini ku kumeka vanhu vo lulama va khume ntsena. HOSI Xikwembu xi hlamula yi ku: Hikwalaho ka vanhu lava vo lulama va khume, ndzi nge wu herisi.	Then he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak again but this once. Suppose ten are found there. He answered, For the sake of ten I will not destroy it.
Loko HOSI Xikwembu xi hetile ku vulavula na Abrahama, xi suka xi famba, kutani Abrahama a tlhelela entsongeni wa yena.	And the LORD went his way, when he had finished speaking to Abraham, and Abraham returned to his place.
Loko tintsumi leti timbirhi ti fika emutini wa Sodoma, ti kume Lota a tshamile enyangweni ya muti wa Sodoma. Loko Lota a ti vona, a suka a yima a ya ti hlanganisa, a fika a korhama	The two angels came to Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he rose to meet them and bowed himself with his face to the earth
a ku: N'we vini vanga, hambukani mi nghena emutini wa mina nandza wa n'wina, mi ta kumanyana swo phumunha ritshuri emilengeni, mi xwa kona vusiku bya namuntlha, kutani mi ta pfuka nimpundzu mi ya emahlweni ni riendzo ra n'wina. Tintsumi ti hlamula ti ku: E-e, hi ta etlela kwala rivaleni ra muti.	and said, My lords, please turn aside to your servant's house and spend the night and wash your feet. Then you may rise up early and go on your way. They said, No; we will spend the night in the town square.
Kambe Lota a khongotela tintsumi hi matimba ti kondza ti hambuka ti nghena emutini wa yena, a fika a ti lulamisela swakudya, a sweka swinkwa swo-ke-comela, ti dya.	But he pressed them strongly; so they turned aside to him and entered his house. And he made them a feast and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.
Va te va nga si ya eku etleleni, vavanuna va Sodoma va ta ku húmélèlò, va ta hinkwavo, lavakulu ni lavatsongo, ku nga sali na un'we, va fika va rhendzela muti.	But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, both young and old, all the people to the last man, surrounded the house.
Kutani va huwelela Lota va ku: Va kwihi vavanuna lava fikeke laha ka wena madyambu ya namuntlha xana? Hi humesele vona, hi lava ku etlela na vona.	And they called to Lot, Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us, that we may know them.
Kutani Lota a huma, a tlhela a pfala ni rivanti, a ya laha a va ri kona	Lot went out to the men at the entrance, shut the door after him
a ku ka vona: Vamakwerhu, ndza mi kombela, mi nga vi na tihanyi!	and said, I beg you, my brothers, do not act so wickedly.
Vonani, ndzi ni vana vambirhi va vanhwanyana lava nga si tivanaka ni wanuna, yimani ndzi mi humesela vona, mi endla leswi mi swi lavaka ha vona. Loko va ri vavanuna lava, mi nga tshuki mi va khumba, hikuva va tile laha ka mina va ta kuma ko lata rivambu.	Behold, I have two daughters who have not known any man. Let me bring them out to you, and do to them as you please. Only do nothing to these men, for they have come under the shelter of my roof.
Kambe vona va hlamula va ku: Suka endleleni! Va ya emahlweni va ku: Munhu loyi ú tile laha hi ku luvela, kambe sweswi ú tiendla mulamuleri! Hi ta ku endla swo chavisa ku tlula leswi vanhu lava a hi ta va endla swona. Hiloko va susumeta Lota hi matimba, va tshinela erivantini, va lava ku ri tshova.	But they said, Stand back! And they said, This fellow came to sojourn, and he has become the judge! Now we will deal worse with you than with them. Then they pressed hard against the man Lot, and drew near to break the door down.
Kambe vavanuna lava va tintsumi va khoma Lota va n'wi kokela endzeni laha a va ri kona, va tlhela va pfala ni rivanti.	But the men reached out their hands and brought Lot into the house with them and shut the door.
Kavaloko va endla leswaku vavanuna lava a va ri enyangweni hinkwavo, lavakulu ni lavatsongo, va biwa hi riphume, kutani va gugurhuteka va lava nyangwa va kondza va karhala.	And they struck with blindness the men who were at the entrance of the house, both small and great, so that they wore themselves out groping for the door.
Kutani vavanuna lava va tintsumi va ku ka Lota: Xana u ni vanhu van'wana kwala Sodoma, vo fana ni vakon'wana va wena, kumbe vana va wena va majaha ni vanhwana, kumbe xaka ra wena, xana? Va humese va suka emutini lowu	Then the men said to Lot, Have you anyone else here? Sons-in-law, sons, daughters, or anyone you have in the city, bring them out of the place.
hikuva hi le kusuhi ni ku wu herisa: Swivilelo hi tlhelo ra vaaki va wona swi fikile hi xitalo emahlweni ka HOSI Xikwembu, kutani xona xi hi rhumile leswaku hi ta wu herisa.	For we are about to destroy this place, because the outcry against its people has become great before the LORD, and the LORD has sent us to destroy it.
Hiloko Lota a huma a ya byela majaha lawa a ma lava ku teka vana va yena, a ku: Pfukani mi huma emutini lowu, hikuva HOSI Xikwembu xi le kusuhi ni ku wu herisa. Kambe vakon'wana lava va yena, a va vona wonge ú le ku va vungunyeni.	So Lot went out and said to his sons-in-law, who were to marry his daughters, Up! Get out of this place, for the LORD is about to destroy the city. But he seemed to his sons-in-law to be jesting.
Loko vurhonga byi tshwuka, vavanuna lava va tintsumi va byela Lota leswaku a hatla a huma, va ku: Pfuka u teka nsati wa wena ni vana va wena lava vambirhi va xisati lava u nga na vona, mi ta ka mi nga herisiwi swin'we ni muti lowu loko wu avanyisiwa.	As morning dawned, the angels urged Lot, saying, Up! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, lest you be swept away in the punishment of the city.
Loko Lota a ha rhendzeleka-rhendzeleka, vavanuna lava va tintsumi va n'wi khoma hi voko, va khoma ni nsati wa yena ni vana va yena lava vambirhi va va humesa va ya va tshika ehandle ka muti, hikuva HOSI Xikwembu a xi twela Lota vusiwana.	But he lingered. So the men seized him and his wife and his two daughters by the hand, the LORD being merciful to him, and they brought him out and set him outside the city.
Loko va va humeserile ehandle ka muti, HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Lota: Loko u lava ku pona, tsutsuma u nga languti endzhaku, naswona u nga yimi laha nkoveni; tsutsumela etintshaveni u ta ka u nga lovisiwi.	And as they brought them out, one said, Escape for your life. Do not look back or stop anywhere in the valley. Escape to the hills, lest you be swept away.
Kambe Lota a hlamula a ku: E-e, we N'wini wanga	And Lot said to them, Oh, no, my lords.
u kombile leswaku wa ndzi tsakela mina nandza wa wena; tintswalo ta wena eka mina i tikulu ngopfu hikuva u ndzi ponisile, kambe ndzi nge swi koti ku tsutsumela etintshaveni hikuva ndzi nga weriwa hi khombo ndza ha ri endleleni, kutani ndzi fa.	Behold, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have shown me great kindness in saving my life. But I cannot escape to the hills, lest the disaster overtake me and I die.
Vona, ku ni muti kwala kusuhani, ndzi vula ximutana lexiya; ndzi pfumelele ku ya tumbela eka xona. I ximutana xitsongo, nkarhi wun'wana ndzi nga pona eka xona, a hi swona ke?	Behold, this city is near enough to flee to, and it is a little one. Let me escape there—is it not a little one?—and my life will be saved!
HOSI Xikwembu xi hlamula yi ku: Hiswona, ndza xi amukela xikombelo xa wena, a ndzi nga wu herisi muti lowu u wu vulaka.	He said to him, Behold, I grant you this favor also, that I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken.
Hatlisa u tsutsuma u ya kona, hikuva ndzi nge koti ku endla nchumu loko u nga si fika kwale! Hikokwalaho, muti lowu wu thyiwile vito ra Sowara.	Escape there quickly, for I can do nothing till you arrive there. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
Loko Lota a fika eSowara, dyambu a ra ha ku tlhava.	The sun had risen on the earth when Lot came to Zoar.
Hiloko HOSI Xikwembu xi nisa ndzilo ni xivavula, swi huma eka xona etilweni, swi wela ehenhla ka miti ya Sodoma na Gomora.	Then the LORD rained on Sodom and Gomorrah sulfur and fire from the LORD out of heaven.
HOSI Xikwembu xi herisa miti leyi, ni tindhawu hinkwato ta kwala nkoveni; xi herisa ni vaaki va kona hinkwavo, ni swimila swa tiko ra kona hinkwaro.	And he overthrew those cities, and all the valley, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and what grew on the ground.
Kambe nsati wa Lota a hundzuluka a languta endzhaku, kutani a hundzuka tshuka ra munyu.	But Lot's wife, behind him, looked back, and she became a pillar of salt.
Abrahama yena ú pfukile nimpundzu swinene a ya laha a a yimile kona emahlweni ka HOSI Xikwembu.	And Abraham went early in the morning to the place where he had stood before the LORD.
Loko Abrahama a languta hansi enkoveni, etlhelo ra Sodoma na Gomora, ni tindhawu hinkwato leti nga nkoveni, o vona musi wu ri karhi wu tuvika etikweni, wu ya ehenhla ku fana ni musi wa le xitikweni lexikulu.	And he looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and toward all the land of the valley, and he looked and, behold, the smoke of the land went up like the smoke of a furnace.
Loko Xikwembu xi herisa miti ya le nkoveni leyi Lota a a tshama eka yona, a xi ri karhi xi tsundzuka Abrahama; hikokwalaho, xi humesile Lota xi n'wi susa emitini leyi a xi lava ku yi herisa.	So it was that, when God destroyed the cities of the valley, God remembered Abraham and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow when he overthrew the cities in which Lot had lived.
Lota a a chava ku tshama emutini wa Sowara; hiloko a suka ni vana va yena vambirhi va vanhwanyana, va tlhandluka va kongoma etintshaveni, va fika va tshama ebakweni.	Now Lot went up out of Zoar and lived in the hills with his two daughters, for he was afraid to live in Zoar. So he lived in a cave with his two daughters.
Nhwanyana lowa mativula a ku ka ndzisana: Tatana ú dyuharile swinene, tlhandlakambirhi etikweni leri ku hava vavanuna, kutani hi ta kumisa hi mani vana xana?	And the firstborn said to the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man on earth to come in to us after the manner of all the earth.
Leswi hi nga endlaka swona, a hi pyopyise tatana hi vhinyo, hi etlela na yena leswaku a ta hi kumisa vana lava nga ta yisa rixaka ra ka hina emahlweni.	Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve offspring from our father.
Hi vusiku byebyo, va pyopyisa tata wa vona hi vhinyo, kutani nhwanyana lowa mativula a ya a ya etlela na tata wa yena, kambe tata wa yena a nga n'wi twanga loko a nghena a etlela ni loko a huma a famba.	So they made their father drink wine that night. And the firstborn went in and lay with her father. He did not know when she lay down or when she arose.
Siku leri tlhandlamaka, nhwanyana lowa mativula a byela ndzisana a ku: Vona, tolo nivusiku mina ndzi etlerile na tatana, kutani a hi tlhele hi n'wi pyopyisa hi vhinyo leswaku vusiku bya namuntlha wena u ta ya etlela na yena, kutani ú ta hi kumisa vana lava nga ta yisa emahlweni rixaka ra ka hina.	The next day, the firstborn said to the younger, Behold, I lay last night with my father. Let us make him drink wine tonight also. Then you go in and lie with him, that we may preserve offspring from our father.
Hiloko vusiku byebyo va tlhela va pyopyisa tata wa vona hi vhinyo, kutani nhwanyana lontsongo a ya a ya etlela na yena. Tata wa yena a nga n'wi twanga loko a nghena a etlela, ni loko a huma a famba.	So they made their father drink wine that night also. And the younger arose and lay with him, and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose.
Kutani vana va Lota hi vambirhi ka vona va tikisiwa hi tata wa vona.	Thus both the daughters of Lot became pregnant by their father.
Lowa mativula a kuma n'wana wa mufana, kutani a n'wi thya vito ra Mowabu; hi yena tata wa Vamowabu lava nga kona ni namuntlha.	The firstborn bore a son and called his name Moab. He is the father of the Moabites to this day.
Lontsongo na yena a kuma n'wana wa mufana, kutani a n'wi thya vito ra Benami; hi yena tata wa Vaamori lava nga kona ni namuntlha.	The younger also bore a son and called his name Ben-ammi. He is the father of the Ammonites to this day.
Ku suka kwalaho, Abrahama a famba a kongoma ematlhelweni ya le dzongeni, a ya fika a luvela emutini wa Gerara, exikarhi ka Kadexe na Xuru, a tshama kona.	From there Abraham journeyed toward the territory of the Negeb and lived between Kadesh and Shur; and he sojourned in Gerar.
Kutani Abrahama a byela vanhu leswaku Sara nsati wa yena i makwavo wa yena; hiloko Abimeleke hosi ya muti wa Gerara a rhuma vanhu va ya teka Sara.	And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister. And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah.
Kambe nivusiku, Xikwembu xi ta eka Abimeleke hi norho, xi ku: Wena, u ta fa, hikwalaho ka wansati loyi u n'wi tekeke, hikuva i nsati wa munhu.	But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night and said to him, Behold, you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken, for she is a man's wife.
Abimeleke a a nga si tshinela eka Sara; hiloko a ku: We n'wini wanga, xana u ngo dlaya vanhu lava nga riki na nandzu xana?	Now Abimelech had not approached her. So he said, Lord, will you kill an innocent people?
Abrahama ú vule hi yexe a ku: ‘Loyi i makwerhu.’ Kasi na yena wansati ú vule hi nomo wa yena a ku: ‘Loyi i makwerhu.’ Mhaka leyi, ndzi yi endlile ndzi ntshunxekile embilwini, ndzi nga voni nchumu xo biha eka yona.	Did he not himself say to me, 'She is my sister'? And she herself said, 'He is my brother.' In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands I have done this.
Hiloko Xikwembu xi vulavula na yena enorhweni xi ku: Kunene wa vurisa; ndza swi tiva leswaku u endlile mhaka leyi hi mbilu yo ntshunxeka, hikokwalaho ndzi endleke leswaku u nga ndzi dyoheli. Hi mina ndzi ku siveleke ku khumba wansati loyi.	Then God said to him in the dream, Yes, I know that you have done this in the integrity of your heart, and it was I who kept you from sinning against me. Therefore I did not let you touch her.
Kutani sweswi, tlherisela wansati loyi eka nuna wa yena, hikuva wanuna loyi i muprofeta, ú ta ku khongelela u hanya, kambe loko u nga tlherisi wansati loyi, swi tive leswaku u ta fa hakunene, wena ni va ka n'wina hinkwavo.	Now then, return the man's wife, for he is a prophet, so that he will pray for you, and you shall live. But if you do not return her, know that you shall surely die, you and all who are yours.
Kutani Abimeleke a pfuka nimpundzu swinene, a vitana malandza ya yena hinkwawo, a ma vikela swilo hinkwaswo leswi humeleleke; kutani vavanuna lava va khomiwa hi ku chava lokukulu.	So Abimelech rose early in the morning and called all his servants and told them all these things. And the men were very much afraid.
Kwalaho Abimeleke a vitana Abrahama a ku: Xana i mhaka muni leyi u hi vangeleke yona xana? Xana ndzi ku dyohele yini, lero kala u ndzi vangela xidyoho lexikulu, mina ni tiko ra mina xana? Mhaka leyi u ndzi endleleke yona, a yi nga fanelanga ku va yi endlekile.	Then Abimelech called Abraham and said to him, What have you done to us? And how have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and my kingdom a great sin? You have done to me things that ought not to be done.
Kutani Abimeleke a vutisa Abrahama a ku: Xana a wu ehleketa yini loko u endla mhaka leyi xana?	And Abimelech said to Abraham, What did you see, that you did this thing?
Abrahama a ku: Loko ndzi endla mhaka leyi, a ndzi ehleketa leswaku endhawini leyi ku ta va ku ri hava na munhu na un'we loyi a chavaka Xikwembu, kutani a ndzi anakanya leswaku vanhu va kona va nga ndzi dlaya hikwalaho ka nsati wa mina.	Abraham said, I did it because I thought, 'There is no fear of God at all in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.'
Kasi nakona, loyi wo va makwerhu hakunene; hi lo hambana ntsena hi vamanana, tatana i un'we; kambe sweswi i nsati wa mina.	Besides, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father though not the daughter of my mother, and she became my wife.
Loko Xikwembu xi ndzi susa emutini wa tatana ndzi famba ndzi tsendzeleka, ndzi te ka nsati: ‘Xilo lexi ndzi kombelaka leswaku u ndzi pfuna ha xona hi lexi: Endhawini yin'wana ni yin'wana leyi hi fikaka eka yona, va byele leswaku u makwerhu!’ 	And when God caused me to wander from my father's house, I said to her, 'This is the kindness you must do me: at every place to which we come, say of me, He is my brother.'
Kutani Abimeleke a teka tinyimpfu, ni tihomu, ni mahlonga ya xinuna ni ya xisati, a nyika Abrahama; a n'wi tlherisela na Sara nsati wa yena.	Then Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and male servants and female servants, and gave them to Abraham, and returned Sarah his wife to him.
Kutani Abimeleke a ku: Loko ri ri tiko ra mina, hi reri u ri vonaka; tiakele laha u ku rhandzaka.	And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before you; dwell where it pleases you.
Kutani Abimeleke a ku ka Sara: Ndzi nyikile makwenu mali ya tisilivhere ta 1 000; leswi swi ta va xikombiso eka vanhu hinkwavo lava u nga na vona, leswaku a wu na nandzu, naswona u lulamile emahlweni ka munhu un'wana ni un'wana.	To Sarah he said, Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver. It is a sign of your innocence in the eyes of all who are with you, and before everyone you are vindicated.
Hiloko Abrahama a khongela Xikwembu, kutani xona xi horisa Abimeleke ni nsati wa yena, ni mahlonga ya yena ya xisati, leswaku va kota ku kuma vana	Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, and also healed his wife and female slaves so that they bore children.
hikuva va ka Abimeleke hinkwavo HOSI Xikwembu a xi va pfarile mbeleko hikokwalaho ka Sara nkata Abrahama.	For the LORD had closed all the wombs of the house of Abimelech because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.
HOSI Xikwembu xi katekisa Sara hilaha xi vuleke hakona, xi n'wi endlela leswi xi n'wi tshembiseke swona.	The LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did to Sarah as he had promised.
Kutani eku dyuhaleni ka Abrahama, Sara a tika, a n'wi velekela n'wana wa mufana hi nkarhi lowu Xikwembu xi wu tiviseke Abrahama.	And Sarah conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age at the time of which God had spoken to him.
Kutani Abrahama a thya n'wana loyi Sara a n'wi velekeleke yena evito ra Isaka.	Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore him, Isaac.
Loko Isaka a ri ni masiku ya 8, tata wa yena Abrahama a n'wi yimbisa, hi ku landza xileriso xa Xikwembu.	And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him.
Abrahama a a ri ni malembe ya dzana loko Isaka n'wana wa yena a velekiwa.	Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.
Kutani Sara a ku: Xikwembu xi ndzi nyikile nkarhi wa ku hleka, kutani un'wana ni un'wana loyi a nga ta swi twa, ú ta hleka na mina.	And Sarah said, God has made laughter for me; everyone who hears will laugh over me.
Sara a ya emahlweni a ku: I mani loyi a a ta khorwisa Abrahama leswaku siku rin'wana mina Sara ndzi ta mamisa vana xana? Hi leswi, eku dyuhaleni ka yena ndzi n'wi velekerile n'wana wa mufana!	And she said, Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age.
Loko Isaka a kurile, a lumuriwa. Hi siku ra ku lumuriwa ka yena, Abrahama a endla nkhuvo lowukulu.	And the child grew and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.
Kutani Sara a vona Iximaele n'wana Hagara lowa Muegipta na Abrahama, a ri karhi a tlanga na Isaka n'wana wa yena.	But Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, laughing.
Hiloko Sara a ku ka Abrahama: Hlongola wansati loyi wa hlonga ni n'wana wa yena, hikuva a ndzi lavi leswaku n'wana wa yena a dya ndzhaka swin'we na Isaka n'wananga.	So she said to Abraham, Cast out this slave woman with her son, for the son of this slave woman shall not be heir with my son Isaac.
Mhaka leyi, Abrahama yi n'wi khunguvanyisile ngopfu, loko a ehleketa Iximaele n'wana wa yena.	And the thing was very displeasing to Abraham on account of his son.
Kambe Xikwembu xi ku ka Abrahama: U nga tshuki u khunguvanyeka hikwalaho ka n'wana wa wena ni wansati lowa hlonga ra wena; endla xin'wana ni xin'wana lexi Sara a ku byelaka xona, hikuva Isaka hi yena a nga ta yisa vito ra wena emahlweni.	But God said to Abraham, Be not displeased because of the boy and because of your slave woman. Whatever Sarah says to you, do as she tells you, for through Isaac shall your offspring be named.
Loko a ri Iximaele n'wana wa wansati lowa hlonga, ndzi ta n'wi endla tiko lerikulu hikuva na yena i n'wana wa wena.	And I will make a nation of the son of the slave woman also, because he is your offspring.
Hiloko Abrahama a pfuka nimpundzu swinene, a teka xinkwa ni gula ra mati a rhwexa Hagara, a n'wi beburisa ni n'wana, kutani a n'wi hlongola. Hiloko Hagara a suka a famba a ya tsendzeleka emananga ya Berexeba.	So Abraham rose early in the morning and took bread and a skin of water and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, along with the child, and sent her away. And she departed and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.
Kuteloko mati ma herile eguleni, Hagara o teka n'wana wa yena a ya n'wi veka ehansi ka ximudyana xin'wana.	When the water in the skin was gone, she put the child under one of the bushes.
Kutani a suka laha a ku ri na n'wana a famba mpfhukanyana, a ya fika a tshama ehansi, hikuva a a ku: A ndzi lavi ku vona ku fa ka n'wananga. Kuteloko Hagara a ri kwale kule, n'wana a sungula ku rila.	Then she went and sat down opposite him a good way off, about the distance of a bowshot, for she said, Let me not look on the death of the child. And as she sat opposite him, she lifted up her voice and wept.
Xirilo xa xifanyetana lexi xi fikile etindleveni ta Xikwembu, kutani ntsumi ya Xikwembu yi huwelela Hagara yi ri etilweni, yi ku ka yena: Hagara, u karhata hi yini xana? U nga chavi hikuva Xikwembu xi twile xirilo xa xifanyetana kwale hansi ka ximudyana.	And God heard the voice of the boy, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, What troubles you, Hagar? Fear not, for God has heard the voice of the boy where he is.
Suka u yima u ya tlakula xifanyetana, u nga xi tshiki, hikuva ndzi ta xi endla tiko lerikulu.	Up! Lift up the boy, and hold him fast with your hand, for I will make him into a great nation.
Kutani Xikwembu xi pfula Hagara mahlo, a vona xihlovo; hiloko a tata gula ra yena hi mati, a nyika ni xifanyetana xi nwa.	Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. And she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink.
Xikwembu xi va ni n'wana loyi, kutani a tikulela, a tshama emananga, a tiva swinene ku copa hi nseve.	And God was with the boy, and he grew up. He lived in the wilderness and became an expert with the bow.
A a tshama emananga ya Parani; kutani mana wa yena a ya n'wi tekela nsati etikweni ra Egipta.	He lived in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt.
Enkarhini wolowo, Abimeleke a ya eka Abrahama a ri na Pikolo mufambisi wa mavuthu ya yena, a fika a ku ka Abrahama: Xikwembu xi na wena eka hinkwaswo leswi u swi endlaka	At that time Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army said to Abraham, God is with you in all that you do.
hikokwalaho, ndzi kombela leswaku u ndzi tshembisa hi ku hlambanya emahlweni ka Xikwembu leswaku u nga ka u nga ndzi kanganyisi, mina ni vana va mina kumbe vatukulu va mina; ndzi tshembise leswaku leswi ndzi kombeke ku tshembeka ka mina eka wena, na wena u ta endla tano eka mina ni tiko ra mina leri u luveleke eka rona.	Now therefore swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me or with my descendants or with my posterity, but as I have dealt kindly with you, so you will deal with me and with the land where you have sojourned.
Abrahama a hlamula a ku: Ndzi ta hlambanya.	And Abraham said, I will swear.
Hiloko Abrahama a vilela eka Abimeleke hi mhaka ya xihlovo lexi malandza ya Abimeleke ma n'wi tekeleke xona.	When Abraham reproved Abimelech about a well of water that Abimelech's servants had seized
Kutani Abimeleke a hlamula a ku: A ndzi tivi leswaku i vamani va endleke mhaka leyi; hambi u ri wena a wu nga si tshama u ndzi byela mhaka leyi; mina ndzi yi twa ro sungula sweswi u ndzi hlamuselaka yona namuntlha.	Abimelech said, I do not know who has done this thing; you did not tell me, and I have not heard of it until today.
Hiloko Abrahama a teka tinyimpfu ni tihomu a nyika Abimeleke; kutani vavanuna lava vambirhi va endla xinakulobye.	So Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and the two men made a covenant.
Abrahama a hlawula swinyimpfana swa xisati swa 7 entlhambini, a swi veka etlhelo.	Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock apart.
Kutani Abimeleke a vutisa Abrahama a ku: Xana u kombisa yini hi swinyimpfana leswi swa xisati swa 7 leswi u swi hlawuleke u swi veka etlhelo xana?	And Abimelech said to Abraham, What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs that you have set apart?
Abrahama a hlamula a ku: Wena amukela swinyimpfana leswi swa xisati swa 7 eka mina, leswaku u ta va mbhoni ya mina ku tiyisa leswaku hi mina ndzi celeke xihlovo lexi.	He said, These seven ewe lambs you will take from my hand, that this may be a witness for me that I dug this well.
Hikokwalaho ndhawu leyi yi thyiwile vito ra Berexeba, hikuva hi kona laha vavanuna lava vambirhi va nga hlambanya va ri kona.	Therefore that place was called Beersheba, because there both of them swore an oath.
Kutani Abrahama na Abimeleke va endla xinakulobye eBerexeba. Endzhaku ka swona, Abimeleke na Pikolo mufambisi wa mavuthu ya yena va suka va famba va tlhelela etikweni ra Vafilista.	So they made a covenant at Beersheba. Then Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army rose up and returned to the land of the Philistines.
Kutani Abrahama a byala murhi wa tamarisiki eBerexeba, a khongelela kona HOSI, xona Xikwembu lexi nga kona hilaha ku nga heriki.	Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba and called there on the name of the LORD, the Everlasting God.
Abrahama ú tshamile malembe yo tala etikweni ra Vafilista a ri muluveri.	And Abraham sojourned many days in the land of the Philistines.
Endzhaku ka timhaka leti, Xikwembu xi kambela Abrahama xi ku: Abrahama! Yena a hlamula a ku: Hi mina loyi.	After these things God tested Abraham and said to him, Abraham! And he said, Here I am.
Xi ku ka yena: Teka Isaka n'wana wa wena loyi a ngo va un'we, loyi naswona u n'wi rhandzaka, kutani u ya etikweni ra Moriya u ya humesa ha yena gandzelo leri hisiwaka, u ri humesela ehenhla ka ntshava leyi ndzi nga ta ku komba yona.	He said, Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you.
Hiloko Abrahama a pfuka nimpundzu swinene, a bohelela xitshamu embhongolweni ya yena, a vita malandza ya yena mambirhi ya majaha, a teka na Isaka n'wana wa yena. Loko a tsemile tihunyi to ya hisa ha tona gandzelo, a suka a famba a kongoma endhawini leyi Xikwembu xi n'wi byeleke yona.	So Abraham rose early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and his son Isaac. And he cut the wood for the burnt offering and arose and went to the place of which God had told him.
Hi siku ra vunharhu, Abrahama ú te a tlukusa mahlo, o vona ndhawu ya kona ya ha ri kulenyana.	On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place from afar.
Kutani a ku ka malandza ya yena: Salani mi tshamile kwala ni mbhongolo leyi; mina ni jaha leri ha ha ya endhawini liya hi ya gandzela, hi ta vuya hi mi kuma kwala.	Then Abraham said to his young men, Stay here with the donkey; I and the boy will go over there and worship and come again to you.
Kutani Abrahama a teka tihunyi to hisa ha tona gandzelo a rhwexa n'wana wa yena Isaka, yena a khoma ndzilo ni mukwana, kutani va suka va famba swin'we.	And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son. And he took in his hand the fire and the knife. So they went both of them together.
Hiloko Isaka a ku ka tata wa yena: Tatana! Yena a ku: Hi mina loyi n'wananga. Isaka a ku: Ndzilo ni tihunyi hi leswi, kambe xinyimpfana xa gandzelo leri hisiwaka xi kwihi xana?	And Isaac said to his father Abraham, My father! And he said, Here I am, my son. He said, Behold, the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?
Abrahama a hlamula a ku: N'wananga, loko swi ri swa xinyimpfana xa gandzelo leri hisiwaka, swi ta vona hi Xikwembu. Kutani va ya emahlweni va famba swin'we.	Abraham said, God will provide for himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son. So they went both of them together.
Loko va fika endhawini leyi Xikwembu xi n'wi byeleke yona, Abrahama a aka alitari, a veketela tihunyi ehenhla ka yona, kutani a boha n'wana wa yena Isaka, a n'wi tlhandleka alitarini ehenhla ka tihunyi.	When they came to the place of which God had told him, Abraham built the altar there and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood.
Kutani Abrahama a teka mukwana a lava ku dlaya n'wana wa yena ha wona.	Then Abraham reached out his hand and took the knife to slaughter his son.
Kambe ntsumi ya HOSI Xikwembu yi n'wi vitana yi ri etilweni yi ku: Abrahama! Abrahama! Yena a pfumela a ku: Hi mina loyi.	But the angel of the LORD called to him from heaven and said, Abraham, Abraham! And he said, Here I am.
Yi ku ka yena: N'wana yoloye u nga tshuki u n'wi endla nchumu, ni ku n'wi khumba u nga n'wi khumbi. Sweswi ndza swi tiva leswaku wa xi chava Xikwembu, hikuva a wu alanga ku xi nyika n'wana wa wena loyi a ngo va un'we.	He said, Do not lay your hand on the boy or do anything to him, for now I know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me.
Abrahama a tlakusa mahlo, kutani a vona nyimpfu ya khuna yi phasiwile timhondzo hi xihlahla. Kutani Abrahama a ya yi teka a humesa ha yona gandzelo leri hisiwaka, ematshan'weni ya n'wana wa yena.	And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, behind him was a ram, caught in a thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram and offered it up as a burnt offering instead of his son.
Kutani Abrahama a thya ndhawu leyi vito ra HOSI-yita-swi-vona; ni namuntlha vanhu va ha vula va ku: Entshaveni ya HOSI, swi ta voniwa.	So Abraham called the name of that place, The LORD will provide; as it is said to this day, On the mount of the LORD it shall be provided.
Kutani ntsumi ya HOSI Xikwembu yi vitana Abrahama ra vumbirhi yi ri etilweni	And the angel of the LORD called to Abraham a second time from heaven
yi ku: HOSI yi ri: ‘Ndza hlambanya mina hi xiviri hikwalaho ka leswi u swi endleke: A wu alanga na n'wana wa wena loyi a ngo va un'we.	and said, By myself I have sworn, declares the LORD, because you have done this and have not withheld your son, your only son
Hikokwalaho, ndzi ta ku katekisa, ndzi ku nyika vatukulu lavo tala ku fana ni tinyeleti etilweni ni sava eribuweni ra lwandle, va ta hlula ni valala va vona.	I will surely bless you, and I will surely multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven and as the sand that is on the seashore. And your offspring shall possess the gate of his enemies
Kutani vanhu hinkwavo laha misaveni va ta katekisiwa hikwalaho ka vatukulu va wena, hikuva wena u yingisile rito ra mina.’ 	and in your offspring shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because you have obeyed my voice.
Kutani Abrahama a tlhelela laha malandza ya yena a ma ri kona, va suka va famba swin'we va kongoma eBerexeba, laha Abrahama a a tshama kona.	So Abraham returned to his young men, and they arose and went together to Beersheba. And Abraham lived at Beersheba.
Endzhaku ka timhaka leti, Abrahama a twa leswaku makwavo wa yena Nahoro ú velekeriwile vana hi nsati wa yena Milika, va nga lava	Now after these things it was told to Abraham, Behold, Milcah also has borne children to your brother Nahor
Usi, mativula ya kona, na Buzi, na Kemuwele tata wa Aramu	Uz his firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram
na Kesede, na Hazo, na Pilidaxi, na Yidilafu, na Betuwele	Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.
tata wa Rhaveka. Vana lava va 8, Milika ú va velekerile Nahoro makwavo wa Abrahama.	(Bethuel fathered Rebekah.) These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham's brother.
Kasi Rhewuna, nsati lontsongo wa Nahoro, ú n'wi velekerile Taba, na Gahamu, na Tahaxi, na Maaka.	Moreover, his concubine, whose name was Reumah, bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.
Sara ú hanyile malembe ya 127	Sarah lived 127 years; these were the years of the life of Sarah.
kutani a lovela emutini wa Kiriyata-Araba (hileswaku Hebroni) etikweni ra Kanana. Abrahama a ya a ya rila nkosi wa Sara	And Sarah died at Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan, and Abraham went in to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her.
kutani a suka laha a ku ri na mufi a ya eka Vahiti, a fika a ku	And Abraham rose up from before his dead and said to the Hittites
Mina ndzi munhu wa le handle loyi a luveleke exikarhi ka n'wina; kutani sweswi ndzi kombela leswaku mi ndzi nyika ndhawu leyi yi nga ta va ya mina yo lahlela eka yona, leswaku ndzi ta lahla mufi wa mina ndzi hambana na yena.	I am a sojourner and foreigner among you; give me property among you for a burying place, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
Vahiti va hlamula Abrahama va ku	The Hittites answered Abraham
Yingisa hi ku byela, we n'wini wa hina; exikarhi ka hina, wena u munhu wo chaviseka! Loko ku ri ku lahla mufi wa wena, hlawula sirha leri sasekeke ngopfu exikarhi ka masirha ya hina hinkwawo. A ku na munhu na un'we exikarhi ka hina loyi a nga alaka ku ku nyika sirha ra yena, kumbe loyi a nga ku sivelaka ku lahla mufi wa wena.	Hear us, my lord; you are a prince of God among us. Bury your dead in the choicest of our tombs. None of us will withhold from you his tomb to hinder you from burying your dead.
Hiloko Abrahama a suka a yima, a korhama emahlweni ka Vahiti, vona vinyi va tiko	Abraham rose and bowed to the Hittites, the people of the land.
a ku ka vona: Loko hakunene mi swi tsakela leswaku ndzi lahla mufi wa mina ndzi hambana na yena, ndzi pfuneni, mi ya ndzi vulavulela na Efroni n'wana Sohara	And he said to them, If you are willing that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me and entreat for me Ephron the son of Zohar
leswaku a ndzi nyika bako ra Makapela, leri ri nga ra yena; ri le makumu ka nsimu ya yena. Mi n'wi kombela leswaku a ndzi nyika rona ni ku ndzi byela nxavo wa rona hinkwawo emahlweni ka n'wina, leswaku ri ta va ndhawu ya mina yo lahlela eka yona.	that he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he owns; it is at the end of his field. For the full price let him give it to me in your presence as property for a burying place.
Efroni a a tshamile exikarhi ka Vahiti lava. Hiloko Efroni loyi wa Muhiti a hlamula Abrahama, hinkwavo lava a va hlengeletanile enyangweni ya muti va ri karhi va swi twa, a ku	Now Ephron was sitting among the Hittites, and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the Hittites, of all who went in at the gate of his city
E-e, n'wini wanga, yingisa ndzi ku byela; mina ndzi ku nyika nsimu, ku katsa ni bako leri nga ka yona; ndzi ku nyika yona emahlweni ka vanhu va ka hina; yana u ya lahla mufi wa wena kona.	No, my lord, hear me: I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. In the sight of the sons of my people I give it to you. Bury your dead.
Hiloko Abrahama a korhama emahlweni ka vinyi va tiko	Then Abraham bowed down before the people of the land.
a byela Efroni va ri karhi va swi twa a ku: Ndzi kombela leswaku u ndzi lombanyana tindleve; mina ndzi lava ku humesa nxavo wa nsimu leyi, ndzi ku nyika wona; wu amukele leswaku ndzi ta lahla mufi wa mina ensin'wini leyi.	And he said to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, But if you will, hear me: I give the price of the field. Accept it from me, that I may bury my dead there.
Efroni a hlamula Abrahama a ku	Ephron answered Abraham
E-e, yingisa n'wini wanga; xana hi nga phikisana hi nsimu leyi vitanaka tisilivhere ta 400 ntsena ke? Lahla mufi wa wena eka yona!	My lord, listen to me: a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver, what is that between you and me? Bury your dead.
Hiloko Abrahama a nkhenselana na Efroni, a n'wi pimela tisilivhere leti a ti vuleke emahlweni ka Vahiti, ti nga tisilivhere ta 400 hi ku landza mpimo lowu vekiweke hi vamabindzu.	Abraham listened to Ephron, and Abraham weighed out for Ephron the silver that he had named in the hearing of the Hittites, four hundred shekels of silver, according to the weights current among the merchants.
Hi ndlela leyi, ndhawu hinkwayo leyi yi nga eMakapela evuxeni bya Mamre, yi nga nsimu ya Efroni, ni bako leri nga ka yona, ni mirhi hinkwayo leyi mileke matlhelo hinkwawo ya nsimu leyi	So the field of Ephron in Machpelah, which was to the east of Mamre, the field with the cave that was in it and all the trees that were in the field, throughout its whole area, was made over
swi nyikiwa Abrahama emahlweni ka Vahiti hinkwavo lava a va ri enyangweni ya muti, leswaku swi ta va swa yena.	to Abraham as a possession in the presence of the Hittites, before all who went in at the gate of his city.
Endzhaku ka sweswo, Abrahama a lahla nsati wa yena Sara ebakweni leri nga nsin'wini ya le Makapela, evuxeni bya muti wa Mamre (hileswaku Hebroni), etikweni ra Kanana.	After this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah east of Mamre (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan.
Hi mukhuva lowu, Vahiti va nyika Abrahama nsimu leyi ni bako ra yona leswaku yi va ndhawu ya yena yo lahlela eka yona.	The field and the cave that is in it were made over to Abraham as property for a burying place by the Hittites.
Enkarhini lowu, Abrahama a a dyuhele swinene, naswona eka hinkwaswo, HOSI Xikwembu a xi n'wi katekisile.	Now Abraham was old, well advanced in years. And the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things.
Kutani Abrahama a byela nandza wa yena lonkulu, loyi a a hlayisa swilo swa yena hinkwaswo, a ku: Vekela voko ra wena exikarhi ka milenge ya mina	And Abraham said to his servant, the oldest of his household, who had charge of all that he had, Put your hand under my thigh
kutani ndzi ta ku hlambanyisa emahlweni ka HOSI Xikwembu xa matilo ni misava, leswaku u nge tshuki u laverile n'wananga ensati exikarhi ka vanhwanyana va Vakanana lava ndzi tshamaka etikweni ra vona	that I may make you swear by the LORD, the God of heaven and God of the earth, that you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell
kambe u ta ya lavela Isaka n'wananga ensati exikarhi ka va ka hina etikweni ra rikwerhu.	but will go to my country and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son Isaac.
Kutani nandza a ku: Loko nhwana wa kona a nga swi tsakeli ku vuya na mina etikweni leri, xana ndzi fanele ku teka n'wana wa wena ndzi n'wi tlherisela etikweni leri u humaka eka rona xana?	The servant said to him, Perhaps the woman may not be willing to follow me to this land. Must I then take your son back to the land from which you came?
Kutani Abrahama a n'wi hlamula a ku: U nga tshuki u tlherisela n'wananga etikweni leriya ni siku ni rin'we!	Abraham said to him, See to it that you do not take my son back there.
HOSI Xikwembu xa matilo, xona lexi xi ndzi tekeke emutini wa tatana ni ku ndzi humesa etikweni ra rikwerhu, xi ndzi tshembisile hi ku hlambanya leswaku tiko leri xi ta ri nyika vatukulu va mina. Hikokwalaho xi ta rhumela ntsumi emahlweni ka wena, kutani wena u ta ya tekela n'wananga ensati etikweni leriya.	The LORD, the God of heaven, who took me from my father's house and from the land of my kindred, and who spoke to me and swore to me, 'To your offspring I will give this land,' he will send his angel before you, and you shall take a wife for my son from there.
Kambe loko nhwana wa kona a nga swi tsakeli ku vuya na wena, u ta va u ntshunxekile eka leswi ndzi nga ku hlambanyisa swona; kambe n'wananga yena, u nga tshuki u n'wi tlherisela etikweni leriya!	But if the woman is not willing to follow you, then you will be free from this oath of mine; only you must not take my son back there.
Kutani nandza a vekela voko ra yena exikarhi ka milenge ya n'wini wa yena Abrahama, a tiyisa mhaka leyi hi ku hlambanya.	So the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master and swore to him concerning this matter.
Kutani nandza a pambula tikamela ta khume ta n'wini wa yena, a longa ni tinyiko to saseka to hambana-hambana to huma eka n'wini wa yena, a khoma ndlela a kongoma emutini wa Nahoro etikweni ra Mesopotamiya.	Then the servant took ten of his master's camels and departed, taking all sorts of choice gifts from his master; and he arose and went to Mesopotamia to the city of Nahor.
Loko dyambu ri ya eku peleni, hi nkarhi lowu vavasati va humaka va ya ematini ha wona, nandza a fika kusuhi ni xihlovo lexi nga handlenyana ka muti, a etlerisa tikamela kona.	And he made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening, the time when women go out to draw water.
Kutani a khongela a ku: We HOSI, wena Xikwembu xa n'wini wa mina Abrahama, ndzi kombela leswaku u ndzi humelerisa namuntlha, u komba ku tshembeka ka wena eka n'wini wa mina Abrahama.	And he said, O LORD, God of my master Abraham, please grant me success today and show steadfast love to my master Abraham.
Vona, ndzi yimile kusuhi ni xihlovo xa mati, sweswi vanhwana va muti lowu va ta huma va ta eku keni ka mati.	Behold, I am standing by the spring of water, and the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water.
Ndzi ta kombela un'wana wa vona leswaku a rhula khuwana ra yena a ndzi siyela mati. Loko a hlamula a ku: ‘Nwana, ndzi ta nwisa ni tikamela ta wena’, a a ve yena loyi u nga n'wi hlawulela nandza wa wena Isaka. Hi ndlela leyi, ndzi ta swi tiva leswaku u kombile ku tshembeka ka wena eka n'wini wa mina Abrahama.	Let the young woman to whom I shall say, 'Please let down your jar that I may drink,' and who shall say, 'Drink, and I will water your camels'—let her be the one whom you have appointed for your servant Isaac. By this I shall know that you have shown steadfast love to my master.
Loko a nga si heta ku khongela, ko ta ku ta humelela Rhaveka a rhwele khuwana. Rhaveka a a ri n'wana Betuwele. Tata wa Betuwele a a ri Nahoro makwavo wa Abrahama, kasi mana wa yena a a ri Milika.	Before he had finished speaking, behold, Rebekah, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, came out with her water jar on her shoulder.
Nhwana loyi Rhaveka a a sasekile swinene, naswona a a nga si tivana ni wanuna. Kutani Rhaveka a rhelela exihlobyeni, a fika a ka mati, a tlhela a huma.	The young woman was very attractive in appearance, a maiden whom no man had known. She went down to the spring and filled her jar and came up.
Hiloko lowa nandza wa Abrahama a tsutsuma a hlanganisa Rhaveka a fika a ku: Ndzi kelenyana swimatana ekhuwanini ra wena ndzi nwa.	Then the servant ran to meet her and said, Please give me a little water to drink from your jar.
A hlamula a ku: Nwana, we n'wini wanga. Kutani a hatlisa a rhula khuwana ra yena, a n'wi nyika mati a nwa.	She said, Drink, my lord. And she quickly let down her jar upon her hand and gave him a drink.
Loko a hetile ku n'wi nyika mati, a ku ka yena: Ndzi ta kela ni tikamela ta wena ti kondza ti kolwa.	When she had finished giving him a drink, she said, I will draw water for your camels also, until they have finished drinking.
Kutani nhwana a hatlisa a chulula mati lawa a ma ri ekhuwanini a ma chela exitsengeleni, a tlhelela exihlobyeni hi ku tsutsuma, a kela tikamela hinkwato emati ti nwa.	So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough and ran again to the well to draw water, and she drew for all his camels.
Hiloko lowa nandza a xiyaxiya nhwana loyi a miyerile, a lava ku twisisa loko hakunene HOSI Xikwembu xi katekisile riendzo ra yena, kumbe loko xi nga ri katekisanga.	The man gazed at her in silence to learn whether the LORD had prospered his journey or not.
Loko tikamela ti hetile ku nwa mati, lowa nandza a humesa xingwavila xa nsuku xo tika 6 g, ni masindza mambirhi ya nsuku yo tika 120 g lawa Rhaveka a nga ta bela emavokweni.	When the camels had finished drinking, the man took a gold ring weighing a half shekel, and two bracelets for her arms weighing ten gold shekels
Kutani a vutisa a ku: Ndzi byele, xana u n'wana mani xana? Xana eka n'wina ku ni yindlu leyi hi nga rhurheriwaka eka yona xana?	and said, Please tell me whose daughter you are. Is there room in your father's house for us to spend the night?
Rhaveka a n'wi hlamula a ku: Mina ndzi n'wana Betuwele, wa Nahoro na Milika nsati wa yena.	She said to him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.
A ya emahlweni a ku: Eka hina, byanyi bya tikamela ni swakudya swin'wana swa tona swi kona; hambi yi ri yindlu leyi mi nga rhurheriwaka eka yona yi kona.	She added, We have plenty of both straw and fodder, and room to spend the night.
Hiloko lowa nandza a korhama a khongela HOSI Xikwembu	The man bowed his head and worshiped the LORD
a ku: A ku dzunisiwe HOSI, xona Xikwembu xa n'wini wa mina Abrahama, lexi nga tshikangiki ku komba ku tshembeka ka xona ni tintswalo ta xona eka n'wini wa mina. Hi xona lexi xi ndzi rhangeleke eriendzweni ra mina xi ta ndzi fikisa eka makwavo wa n'wini wa mina.	and said, Blessed be the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken his steadfast love and his faithfulness toward my master. As for me, the LORD has led me in the way to the house of my master's kinsmen.
Kutani lowa nhwana a tsutsumela endyangu wa mana wa yena, a fika a hlamusela timhaka leti.	Then the young woman ran and told her mother's household about these things.
X	Rebekah had a brother whose name was Laban. Laban ran out toward the man, to the spring.
X	As soon as he saw the ring and the bracelets on his sister's arms, and heard the words of Rebekah his sister, Thus the man spoke to me, he went to the man. And behold, he was standing by the camels at the spring.
Kutani a ku: Wena la katekisiweke hi HOSI, xana u yimela yini ehandle ka muti xana? Nghena emutini, hikuva yindlu ndzi lunghisile, ni ndhawu ya tikamela yi kona.	He said, Come in, O blessed of the LORD. Why do you stand outside? For I have prepared the house and a place for the camels.
Kutani lowa nandza a ya nghena endlwini, Labani yena a ntshunxa tikamela, a nyika lowa nandza byanyi bya tona ni swakudya swin'wana swa tona; a n'wi nyika ni mati yo hlamba milenge, a nyika ni vavanuna lava a a ri na vona.	So the man came to the house and unharnessed the camels, and gave straw and fodder to the camels, and there was water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.
Swakudya na swona swi vekiwile emahlweni ka yena, kambe yena a ku: Ndzi nga ka ndzi nga dyi loko ndzi nga si rungula leswi ndzi rhumiweke swona. Kutani Labani a ku: Rungula.	Then food was set before him to eat. But he said, I will not eat until I have said what I have to say. He said, Speak on.
Kutani a ku: Mina ndzi nandza wa Abrahama	So he said, I am Abraham's servant.
HOSI yi katekisile n'wini wanga, kutani ú fumile swinene. HOSI yi n'wi nyikile mintlhambi ya swifuwo leswikulu ni leswitsongo, ni silivhere, ni nsuku, ni malandza ya xinuna ni ya xisati, ni tikamela, ni timbhongolo.	The LORD has greatly blessed my master, and he has become great. He has given him flocks and herds, silver and gold, male servants and female servants, camels and donkeys.
Loko Sara, yena nsati wa n'wini wa mina, a dyuharile swinene, ú velekerile n'wini wanga n'wana wa mufana, kutani n'wini wanga ú nyikile n'wana loyi swilo hinkwaswo leswi a nga na swona.	And Sarah my master's wife bore a son to my master when she was old, and to him he has given all that he has.
N'wini wanga ú ndzi hlambanyisile a ku: ‘U nga tshuki u laverile n'wananga ensati exikarhi ka vanhwana va Vakanana lava ndzi tshamaka etikweni ra vona	My master made me swear, saying, 'You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell
kambe u ta ya lavela n'wananga ensati exikarhi ka va ka hina etikweni ra rikwerhu.’	but you shall go to my father's house and to my clan and take a wife for my son.'
Kutani mina ndzi ku eka n'wini wanga: ‘Kumbexana nhwana wa kona a nge swi tsakeli ku vuya na mina.’	I said to my master, 'Perhaps the woman will not follow me.'
Kambe yena a ku ka mina: ‘HOSI Xikwembu lexi ndzi xi tirhelaka xi ta rhumela ntsumi ya xona yi famba na wena, xi katekisa ni riendzo ra wena; kutani wena u ta ya tekela n'wananga ensati exiharhi ka va ka hina etikweni ra rikwerhu.	But he said to me, 'The LORD, before whom I have walked, will send his angel with you and prosper your way. You shall take a wife for my son from my clan and from my father's house.
Kutani loko u fikile eka va ka hina, u ta va u ntshunxekile eka leswi ndzi nga ku hlambanyisa swona; naswona loko va nga swi tsakeli ku ku nyika yena u vuya na yena, u ta va u ntshunxekile eka leswi ndzi nga ku hlambanyisa swona.’	Then you will be free from my oath, when you come to my clan. And if they will not give her to you, you will be free from my oath.'
Kutani namuntlha loko ndzi fika exihlobyeni xa mati, ndzi khongerile ndzi ku: ‘We HOSI, wena Xikwembu xa n'wini wa mina Abrahama, ndzi kombela leswaku u ndzi humelerisa eriendzweni ra mina.	I came today to the spring and said, 'O LORD, the God of my master Abraham, if now you are prospering the way that I go
Vona, ndzi yimile kusuhi ni xihlovo xa mati, kutani ndzi ta kombela nhwana loyi a nga ta ta eku keni ka mati leswaku a ndzi siyela mati yo nwa ekhuwanini ra yena.	behold, I am standing by the spring of water. Let the virgin who comes out to draw water, to whom I shall say, Please give me a little water from your jar to drink,
Loko a hlamula a ku: Nwana, ndzi ta nwisa ni tikamela ta wena, a a ve yena loyi wena HOSI u n'wi hlawuleleke n'wana wa n'wini wa mina.’	and who will say to me, Drink, and I will draw for your camels also, let her be the woman whom the LORD has appointed for my master's son.'
Loko ndzi nga si heta ku khongela, ko ta ku ta humelela Rhaveka a rhwele khuwana, a rhelela a ya ka mati. Kutani ndzi ku ka yena: ‘Ndzi kombela swimatana swo nwa.’	Before I had finished speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came out with her water jar on her shoulder, and she went down to the spring and drew water. I said to her, 'Please let me drink.'
Kutani a hatlisa a rhula khuwana, a ku: ‘Nwana, ndzi ta nwisa ni tikamela ta wena.’ Hiloko ndzi nwa, kutani ndzi nwisa ni tikamela.	She quickly let down her jar from her shoulder and said, 'Drink, and I will give your camels drink also.' So I drank, and she gave the camels drink also.
Kutani ndzi n'wi vutisa ndzi ku: ‘U n'wana mani xana?’ Yena a ku: ‘Ndzi n'wana Betuwele, wa Nahoro na Milika nsati wa yena.’ Kutani ndzi n'wi vekela xingwavila enhompfini, ndzi n'wi bela ni masindza emavokweni.	Then I asked her, 'Whose daughter are you?' She said, 'The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bore to him.' So I put the ring on her nose and the bracelets on her arms.
Kutani ndzi korhama ndzi khongela HOSI, ni ku yi dzunisa, xona Xikwembu xa n'wini wa mina Abrahama, lexi xi ndzi kombeke ndlela ku kondza ndzi ta tekela Isaka n'wana Abrahama ensati, eka Nahoro makwavo wa Abrahama.	Then I bowed my head and worshiped the LORD and blessed the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me by the right way to take the daughter of my master's kinsman for his son.
Kutani sweswi, ndzi kombela leswaku mi ndzi byela loko mi tsakela n'wini wanga ni loko mi ta kota ku n'wi pfuna; naswona loko mi nga swi koti ndzi byeleni, ndzi ta tiva leswaku ndzi fanele ku endla yini.	Now then, if you are going to show steadfast love and faithfulness to my master, tell me; and if not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand or to the left.
Kutani Labani na Betuwele va hlamula va ku: Mhaka leyi yi huma eka HOSI, kutani a ku na lexi hina hi nga xi vulaka.	Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing has come from the LORD; we cannot speak to you bad or good.
Vona, Rhaveka hi yoloyi, n'wi teke u famba na yena a ya va nsati wa n'wana wa n'wini wa wena, hilaha HOSI yi vuleke hakona.	Behold, Rebekah is before you; take her and go, and let her be the wife of your master's son, as the LORD has spoken.
Loko nandza wa Abrahama a twa marito ya vona, a korhama a nkhensa HOSI Xikwembu.	When Abraham's servant heard their words, he bowed himself to the earth before the LORD.
Kutani a humesa swo bomba ha swona swa silivhere ni swa nsuku ni swiambalo, a nyika Rhaveka. A nyika ni makwavo wa yena ni mana wa yena swilo swa nkoka swinene.	And the servant brought out jewelry of silver and of gold, and garments, and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave to her brother and to her mother costly ornaments.
Kutani lowa nandza ni vavanuna lava a a ri na vona va dya ni ku nwa, va xwa kona. Loko va pfuka nimpundzu, nandza a ku: Ndzi pfumeleleni ndzi tlhelela eka n'wini wanga.	And he and the men who were with him ate and drank, and they spent the night there. When they arose in the morning, he said, Send me away to my master.
Makwavo wa Rhaveka ni mana wa yena va ku: Hi kombela leswaku nhwanyana loyi a tshamanyana ku ringana kwalomu ka masiku ya khume, kutani endzhaku ka sweswo a nga ha famba.	Her brother and her mother said, Let the young woman remain with us a while, at least ten days; after that she may go.
Kambe lowa nandza a ku ka vona: Mi nga ndzi khomeleti, hikuva HOSI yi katekisile riendzo ra mina; ndzi tshikeni ndzi muka ndzi ya eka n'wini wa mina.	But he said to them, Do not delay me, since the LORD has prospered my way. Send me away that I may go to my master.
Vona va ku: Hi to vitana lowa nhwana hi ta twa leswaku yena ú ri yini.	They said, Let us call the young woman and ask her.
Kutani va vitana Rhaveka va ku ka yena: Xana wa swi lava ku famba ni wanuna loyi xana? Rhaveka a ku: Ina, ndza swi lava.	And they called Rebekah and said to her, Will you go with this man? She said, I will go.
Hiloko va pfumelela makwavo wa vona Rhaveka ni mutirheli wa yena leswaku va famba na nandza wa Abrahama ni vavanuna lava a a ri na vona.	So they sent away Rebekah their sister and her nurse, and Abraham's servant and his men.
Kutani Rhaveka ni tinxangwana ta yena va gada tikamela, va famba ni nandza wa Abrahama; ku va loko nandza loyi a tekile Rhaveka a famba na yena.	Then Rebekah and her young women arose and rode on the camels and followed the man. Thus the servant took Rebekah and went his way.
Enkarhini lowu, Isaka a a sukile eBerilahayi-Royi a ta tshama edzongeni.	Now Isaac had returned from Beer-lahai-roi and was dwelling in the Negeb.
Siku rin'wana hi nkarhi wa madyambu, Isaka a ya emasin'wini ku ya khongela. Kuteloko a tlakusa mahlo, o vona tikamela ti ri karhi ti ta.	And Isaac went out to meditate in the field toward evening. And he lifted up his eyes and saw, and behold, there were camels coming.
Rhaveka ú te a tlakusa mahlo, o vona Isaka, kutani a xika ekameleni	And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she dismounted from the camel
a vutisa lowa nandza a ku: Xana wanuna luya a taka hi le nsin'wini a ta hi hlanganisa i mani xana? Kutani nandza a ku: I n'wini wa mina. Hiloko Rhaveka a teka nturhu a tifunengeta.	and said to the servant, Who is that man, walking in the field to meet us? The servant said, It is my master. So she took her veil and covered herself.
Kutani lowa nandza a rungulela Isaka swilo hinkwaswo leswi a swi endleke.	And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.
Hiloko Isaka a teka Rhaveka a ya na yena entsongeni wa Sara mana wa yena. Kutani Rhaveka a va nsati wa yena loyi a n'wi rhandzaka. Hi ndlela leyi, Isaka a va a kumile xo wisisa mbilu ya yena endzhaku ka rifu ra Sara mana wa yena.	Then Isaac brought her into the tent of Sarah his mother and took Rebekah, and she became his wife, and he loved her. So Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.
Abrahama ú tekile nsati un'wana loyi a va ku i Ketura.	Abraham took another wife, whose name was Keturah.
Kutani Ketura a velekela Abrahama vana lava: Zimrana, na Yokixani, na Medani, na Midiyani, na Yixibaka, na Xuwaka.	She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.
Yokixani hi yena tata wa Xeba na Dedani. Vana va Dedani hi lava: Axuru, na Letuxa, na Lewumi.	Jokshan fathered Sheba and Dedan. The sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim.
Vana va Midiyani hi lava: Efa, na Efere, na Hanoko, na Abida, na Elida. Lava hinkwavo hi vona vatukulu va Ketura.	The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.
Abrahama ú nyikile Isaka swilo hinkwaswo leswi a a ri na swona.	Abraham gave all he had to Isaac.
Vana va vasati va yena lavatsongo, Abrahama ú va nyikile tinyiko ntsena, kutani loko a ha hanya, a va hambanyisa ni n'wana wa yena Isaka, a va yisa etikweni rin'wana ra le vuxeni.	But to the sons of his concubines Abraham gave gifts, and while he was still living he sent them away from his son Isaac, eastward to the east country.
Abrahama ú hanyile malembe ya 175	These are the days of the years of Abraham's life, 175 years.
kutani a tietlelela a ri ni malembe yo tala, a landza va ka vona.	Abraham breathed his last and died in a good old age, an old man and full of years, and was gathered to his people.
Kutani vana va yena Isaka na Iximaele va n'wi lahla ebakweni ra Makapela, ensin'wini ya Efroni n'wana Sohara lowa Muhiti, evuxeni bya Mamre	Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, east of Mamre
yi nga nsimu leyi Abrahama a yi xaveke eka Vahiti. Laha hi kona Abrahama a lahliweke kona, swin'we na Sara nsati wa yena.	the field that Abraham purchased from the Hittites. There Abraham was buried, with Sarah his wife.
Loko Abrahama a lovile, Xikwembu xi katekisa n'wana wa yena Isaka. Isaka a a tshama eBerilahayi-Royi.	After the death of Abraham, God blessed Isaac his son. And Isaac settled at Beer-lahai-roi.
Lava i vana va Iximaele n'wana Abrahama na Hagara lowa Muegipta, nandza wa Sara.	These are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's servant, bore to Abraham.
Mavito ya vona hi ku tlhandlamana ka vona hi lawa: Nebayoto, na Kedari, na Adibiele, na Mibisama	These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, named in the order of their birth: Nebaioth, the firstborn of Ishmael; and Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam
na Mixima, na Duma, na Masa	Mishma, Dumah, Massa
na Hadada, na Tema, na Yeturu, na Nafixi, na Kedema.	Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.
Lawa hi wona mavito ya vana va Iximaele, ti nga tona tindhuna ta 12 ta va ka Iximaele hi ku landza swimitana swa vona ni matshamele ya vona etinyimbeni ta ka vona.	These are the sons of Ishmael and these are their names, by their villages and by their encampments, twelve princes according to their tribes.
Iximaele ú hanyile malembe ya 137, kutani a tietlelela a landza va ka vona.	(These are the years of the life of Ishmael: 137 years. He breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his people.)
Vana va Iximaele a va tshama ku sukela eHavhila ku ya fika eXuru, ku langutana na tiko ra Egipta hi tlhelo ra Asiriya. Vana lava a va tshama va ri karhi va hlaselana.	They settled from Havilah to Shur, which is opposite Egypt in the direction of Assyria. He settled over against all his kinsmen.
Lava i vatukulu va Isaka n'wana Abrahama. Isaka a a ri n'wana Abrahama	These are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham fathered Isaac
kutani loko a ri ni malembe ya 40, a teka Rhaveka n'wana Betuwele lowa Muaramu wa le Padani-Aramu. Makwavo wa Rhaveka wa xinuna a a ri Labani lowa Muaramu.	and Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Aramean, to be his wife.
Rhaveka nkata Isaka a a ri mhika, kutani Isaka a n'wi khongelela eka HOSI, kutani HOSI yi hlamula xikhongelo xa yena, Rhaveka nsati wa yena a tika.	And Isaac prayed to the LORD for his wife, because she was barren. And the LORD granted his prayer, and Rebekah his wife conceived.
Kutani vana va sungula ku kamanyetana ekhwirini ra yena, hiloko Rhaveka a ku: Loko swilo swi famba hi ndlela leyi, xana ndza ha hanyela yini xana? Kutani a ya a ya vutisa timhaka eka HOSI Xikwembu.	The children struggled together within her, and she said, If it is thus, why is this happening to me? So she went to inquire of the LORD.
Siku ra ku tintshunxa ka yena ri fika, kutani a veleka mahahla.	When her days to give birth were completed, behold, there were twins in her womb.
N'wana loyi a rhangeke a huma, a a tshwukile, miri wa yena hinkwawo wu ri na mabvele, wu fana ni xiambalo xa voya, kutani a thyiwa vito ra Esawu.	The first came out red, all his body like a hairy cloak, so they called his name Esau.
Endzhaku ku ta ku ta huma makwavo wa Esawu, a khomile Esawu hi xirhendze; hikokwalaho a thyiwa vito ra Yakobo. Loko Rhaveka a veleka vana lava, Isaka a a ri ni malembe ya 60.	Afterward his brother came out with his hand holding Esau's heel, so his name was called Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.
Loko majaha lawa ma ri karhi ma kula, Esawu a va muhloti lonkulu, a tshama enhoveni, kasi Yakobo yena a a ri munhu wo rhula, loyi a a titshamela ekaya.	When the boys grew up, Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field, while Jacob was a quiet man, dwelling in tents.
Isaka a a tsakela ngopfu Esawu hikuva a a dya swa vuhloti bya yena, kasi Rhaveka yena a a tsakela Yakobo.	Isaac loved Esau because he ate of his game, but Rebekah loved Jacob.
Siku rin'wana loko Yakobo a ri karhi a sweka xixevo, ko ta ku ta fika Esawu a ri ni ndlala swinene, a huma hi le nhoveni.	Once when Jacob was cooking stew, Esau came in from the field, and he was exhausted.
Kutani Esawu a ku ka Yakobo: Ndzi phamelenyana swilo sweswo swo tshwuka ndzi dya, hikuva ndzi ni ndlala swinene. (Hikwalaho ka leswi, Esawu a thyiwa vito ra Edomu, hileswaku ku tshwuka.)	And Esau said to Jacob, Let me eat some of that red stew, for I am exhausted! (Therefore his name was called Edom.)
Yakobo a ku: Sungula u ndzi xavisela vuhosi bya wena.	Jacob said, Sell me your birthright now.
Hiloko Esawu a ku: Leswi ndzi lavaka ku fa, vuhosi byi ta ndzi pfuna yini xana?	Esau said, I am about to die; of what use is a birthright to me?
Kutani Yakobo a ku: Rhanga hi ku ndzi hlambanyela. Hiloko Esawu a tiboha hi ku hlambanya, a xavisela Yakobo vuhosi.	Jacob said, Swear to me now. So he swore to him and sold his birthright to Jacob.
Kavaloko Yakobo a nyika Esawu vuswa ni xixevo xa matsavu, a dya, a tlhela a nwa, kutani a suka a tifambela. Hi mukhuva wolowo, Esawu a va a sorile vuhosi bya yena.	Then Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew, and he ate and drank and rose and went his way. Thus Esau despised his birthright.
Ehandle ka ndlala leyi weke enkarhini wa Abrahama, ku tlherile ku wa yin'wana etikweni. Kutani Isaka a ya eka Abimeleke hosi ya Vafilista emutini wa Gerara.	Now there was a famine in the land, besides the former famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Gerar to Abimelech king of the Philistines.
Hiloko HOSI Xikwembu xi humelela eka yena xi ku: U nga tshuki u ya etikweni ra Egipta, kambe tshama kwala tikweni leri ndzi ku kombaka rona.	And the LORD appeared to him and said, Do not go down to Egypt; dwell in the land of which I shall tell you.
Wena luvela etikweni reri, kutani mina ndzi ta va na wena ndzi ku katekisa, hikuva matiko lawa hinkwawo ndzi ta ku nyika wona, wena ni vatukulu va wena, naswona ndzi ta hetisisa leswi ndzi swi tshembiseke tata wa wena Abrahama hi ku hlambanya.	Sojourn in this land, and I will be with you and will bless you, for to you and to your offspring I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath that I swore to Abraham your father.
Ndzi ta ku nyika vatukulu lavo tala ku fana ni tinyeleti, kutani matiko lawa hinkwawo ndzi ta ma nyika vatukulu va wena, naswona vanhu hinkwavo laha misaveni va ta katekisiwa hikwalaho ka vatukulu va wena	I will multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven and will give to your offspring all these lands. And in your offspring all the nations of the earth shall be blessed
hikuva Abrahama a a ndzi yingisa ni ku endla leswi ndzi n'wi byelaka swona, a hlayisa milawu ya mina, ni swileriso swa mina, ni swiletelo swa mina.	because Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.
Kutani Isaka a tshama eGerara.	So Isaac settled in Gerar.
Loko vaaki va muti va n'wi vutisa hi tlhelo ra nsati wa yena, Isaka a a ku: Loyi i makwerhu. Isaka a a chava ku vula leswaku i nsati wa yena, hikuva a a ehleketa leswaku vaaki va muti wolowo va nga n'wi dlaya hikwalaho ka Rhaveka, hikuva Rhaveka a a sasekile swinene.	When the men of the place asked him about his wife, he said, She is my sister, for he feared to say, My wife, thinking, lest the men of the place should kill me because of Rebekah, because she was attractive in appearance.
Siku rin'wana loko ku hundzile nkarhi Isaka a ri eGerara, Abimeleke a hlometela ehansi hi le fasitereni ra yindlu ya yena, kutani a vona Isaka a vukarhile Rhaveka nsati wa yena.	When he had been there a long time, Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out of a window and saw Isaac laughing with Rebekah his wife.
Kutani Abimeleke a vitana Isaka a ku: Loyi wo va nsati wa wena, kutani hikokwalaho ka yini u vule leswaku i makwenu xana? Isaka a n'wi hlamula a ku: A ndzi ehleketa leswaku va nga ndzi dlaya hikokwalaho ka yena.	So Abimelech called Isaac and said, Behold, she is your wife. How then could you say, 'She is my sister'? Isaac said to him, Because I thought, 'Lest I die because of her.'
Abimeleke a ku: Xana i mhaka muni leyi a wu lava ku hi vangela yona xana? Loko a ku lo va na munhu loyi a nga etlela ni nsati loyi wa wena, a wu ta va u hi vangele nandzu.	Abimelech said, What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us.
Kutani Abimeleke a humesa xileriso lexi nge: Munhu loyi a nga ta tshuka a khumbile wanuna loyi kumbe nsati wa yena, ú ta dlayiwa.	So Abimelech warned all the people, saying, Whoever touches this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.
Kutani Isaka a rima masimu etikweni rero. Hi lembe leri, Isaka a va ni ntshovelo wo tlula ka dzana leswi a swi byaleke. HOSI Xikwembu xi n'wi katekisa	And Isaac sowed in that land and reaped in the same year a hundredfold. The LORD blessed him
a sungula ku humelela, a va ni rifuwo lero tala swinene.	and the man became rich, and gained more and more until he became very wealthy.
A a ri ni mintlhambi ya swifuwo leswikulu ni leswitsongo, ni malandza layo tala, kutani Vafilista va n'wi vondzoka.	He had possessions of flocks and herds and many servants, so that the Philistines envied him.
(Enkarhini lowu, Vafilista a va seleterile swihlovo hinkwaswo leswi malandza ya Abrahama tata wa Isaka a ma swi cerile.)	(Now the Philistines had stopped and filled with earth all the wells that his father's servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father.)
Kutani Abimeleke a ku ka Isaka: Suka exikarhi ka hina, hikuva u sungula ku va ni matimba ku tlula hina.	And Abimelech said to Isaac, Go away from us, for you are much mightier than we.
Kutani Isaka a suka a ya dzima ntsonga wa yena enkoveni wa Gerara, a tshama kona.	So Isaac departed from there and encamped in the Valley of Gerar and settled there.
Kutani a tlhela a handza swihlovo swa mati leswi a swi ceriwile enkarhini wa Abrahama tata wa yena. Swihlovo leswi, Vafilista a va swi seleterile endzhaku ka ku lova ka Abrahama. Isaka ú swi thyile mavito lawa tata wa yena a a swi thyile wona.	And Isaac dug again the wells of water that had been dug in the days of Abraham his father, which the Philistines had stopped after the death of Abraham. And he gave them the names that his father had given them.
Loko malandza ya Isaka ma ri karhi ma cela enkoveni, ma kuma mati lama pfelelaka.	But when Isaac's servants dug in the valley and found there a well of spring water
Kutani varisi va le Gerara va sungula ku holova ni varisi va swifuwo swa Isaka, va ku: Mati lawa i ya hina. Kutani Isaka a thya xihlovo lexi evito ra Eseke (hileswaku: Ku holova), hikuva a va holovile na yena kwalaho.	the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac's herdsmen, saying, The water is ours. So he called the name of the well Esek, because they contended with him.
Kutani va ya cela xihlovo xin'wana, kambe va tlhela va holova hikwalaho ka xona, kutani Isaka a xi thya vito ra Sitina (hileswaku: Ku vengana).	Then they dug another well, and they quarreled over that also, so he called its name Sitnah.
Kutani Isaka a suka a famba a ya cela xihlovo xin'wana, kambe lexi a xa ha va holovisanga; hikokwalaho, xihlovo lexi a xi thya vito ra Rehoboto (hileswaku: Ndhawu-yo-anama), hikuva a a ku: Sweswi HOSI Xikwembu xi hi nyikile ndhawu, kutani hi ta andza etikweni.	And he moved from there and dug another well, and they did not quarrel over it. So he called its name Rehoboth, saying, For now the LORD has made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.
Isaka ú sukile kona a ya eBerexeba.	From there he went up to Beersheba.
Kutani hi vusiku byebyo, HOSI Xikwembu xi humelela eka yena, xi ku: Hi mina Xikwembu xa tata wa wena Abrahama; u nga chavi hikuva ndzi na wena, ndzi ta ku katekisa ndzi ku nyika vatukulu lavo tala hikokwalaho ka nandza wa mina Abrahama.	And the LORD appeared to him the same night and said, I am the God of Abraham your father. Fear not, for I am with you and will bless you and multiply your offspring for my servant Abraham's sake.
Kutani Isaka a aka alitari a gandzela HOSI Xikwembu kona, a tidzimela ni ntsonga wa yena kona, malandza ya yena wona ma cela xihlovo.	So he built an altar there and called upon the name of the LORD and pitched his tent there. And there Isaac's servants dug a well.
Kutani Abimeleke a ya eka Isaka a ri na Ahuzata mutsundzuxi wa yena, na Pikolo mufambisi wa mavuthu ya yena, va sukela eGerara.	When Abimelech went to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath his adviser and Phicol the commander of his army
Isaka a ku ka vona: Leswi mi ndzi vengaka, naswona mi ndzi hlongoleke exikarhi ka n'wina, xana ma ha ta mi ta lava yini haleno xana?	Isaac said to them, Why have you come to me, seeing that you hate me and have sent me away from you?
Vona va hlamula va ku: Ha swi vona leswaku hakunene HOSI Xikwembu xi na wena, kutani hi kombela leswaku wena na hina, hi tiboha hi ku hlambanya, hi va ni xinakulobye.	They said, We see plainly that the LORD has been with you. So we said, let there be a sworn pact between us, between you and us, and let us make a covenant with you
Hi tshembise leswaku u nge tshuki u hi khomile hi tihanyi, tanihi leswi na hina hi nga ku khumbangiki; naswona a hi ku endlanga nchumu xo biha, kambe hi lo ku byela ntsena ku suka exikarhi ka hina hi ku rhula. Sweswi hi wena la katekisiweke hi HOSI Xikwembu.	that you will do us no harm, just as we have not touched you and have done to you nothing but good and have sent you away in peace. You are now the blessed of the LORD.
Kutani Isaka a va endlela nkhuvo, va dya va tlhela va nwa.	So he made them a feast, and they ate and drank.
Kutani va pfuka nimpundzu swinene va tiboha hi ku hlambanya, kutani Isaka a lelana na vona, va suka emutini wa yena hi ku rhula.	In the morning they rose early and exchanged oaths. And Isaac sent them on their way, and they departed from him in peace.
Hi siku rero, malandza ya Isaka ma ta ma ta n'wi byela hi ta xihlovo lexi ma nga xi cela, ma fika ma ku ka yena: Mati hi ma kumile.	That same day Isaac's servants came and told him about the well that they had dug and said to him, We have found water.
Kutani a xi thya vito ra Xiba (hileswaku: Ku hlambanya), hikokwalaho ni namuntlha muti wa kona wa ha tiviwa hi vito ra Berexeba.	He called it Shibah; therefore the name of the city is Beersheba to this day.
Loko Esawu a ri ni malembe ya 40, a teka Yuditi n'wana Beri wa Muhiti, a teka na Basemati n'wana Elone wa Muhiti, va va vasati va yena.	When Esau was forty years old, he took Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite to be his wife, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite
Kutani vavasati lava va dyisa Isaka na Rhaveka embitsi.	and they made life bitter for Isaac and Rebekah.
Loko Isaka a dyuharile swinene, ni mahlo ya yena ma ri ni riphume, ma nga ha voni swinene, a vitana Esawu n'wana wa yena lonkulu, a ku ka yena: N'wananga. Esawu a hlamula a ku: Hi mina loyi.	When Isaac was old and his eyes were dim so that he could not see, he called Esau his older son and said to him, My son; and he answered, Here I am.
Kutani a ku: Vona, sweswi ndzi dyuharile, kambe siku leri ndzi nga ta fa ha rona a ndzi ri tivi.	He said, Behold, I am old; I do not know the day of my death.
Kutani sweswi teka matlhari ya wena, ni vurha bya wena, ni nseve wa wena, u ya enhoveni u ya ndzi hlotela xiharhi	Now then, take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field and hunt game for me
kutani u ndzi lulamisela swakudya swo nandziha leswi ndzi swi tsakelaka, u ndzi tisela swona ndzi ta dya, leswaku ndzi ta ku katekisa ndzi nga si fa.	and prepare for me delicious food, such as I love, and bring it to me so that I may eat, that my soul may bless you before I die.
Rhaveka a a ri karhi a swi twa loko Isaka a vulavula na n'wana wa yena Esawu. Kuteloko Esawu a ha yile enhoveni ku ya hlota	Now Rebekah was listening when Isaac spoke to his son Esau. So when Esau went to the field to hunt for game and bring it
Rhaveka a ku ka Yakobo n'wana wa yena: Ndzi twile tata wa wena a ri karhi a vulavula na makwenu Esawu a ku	Rebekah said to her son Jacob, I heard your father speak to your brother Esau
‘Ndzi lavele xiharhi, kutani u ndzi lunghisela swakudya leswo nandziha ndzi ta dya, leswaku ndzi ta ku katekisa emahlweni ka HOSI Xikwembu ndzi nga si fa.’	'Bring me game and prepare for me delicious food, that I may eat it and bless you before the LORD before I die.'
Kutani sweswi, ndzi yingise we n'wananga, u endla hilaha ndzi ku lerisaka hakona.	Now therefore, my son, obey my voice as I command you.
Famba u ya ndzi tekela swimbutana swimbirhi leswinene entlhambini, leswaku ndzi ta lulamisela tata wa wena swakudya leswo nandziha leswi a swi tsakelaka.	Go to the flock and bring me two good young goats, so that I may prepare from them delicious food for your father, such as he loves.
Kutani wena u ta ya u ya nyika tata wa wena a dya, leswaku a ta ku katekisa a nga si fa.	And you shall bring it to your father to eat, so that he may bless you before he dies.
Kambe Yakobo a ku ka Rhaveka mana wakwe: Vona, makwerhu Esawu i munhu wa ringhala, kasi mina ndzi hava.	But Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, my brother Esau is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.
Kumbexana tatana a nga tshuka a ndzi ambamba, kutani a kuma leswaku ndzi le ku n'wi xiseni, kutani ematshan'weni ya ku katekisiwa ndzi ta tivangela ku rhukaniwa.	Perhaps my father will feel me, and I shall seem to be mocking him and bring a curse upon myself and not a blessing.
Mana wakwe a ku ka yena: We n'wananga, a ku rhukaniwe mina ematshan'weni ya wena! Wena yingisa mina, u famba u ya teka swimbutana u ndzi tisela swona.	His mother said to him, Let your curse be on me, my son; only obey my voice, and go, bring them to me.
Kutani a ya a ya teka swimbutana a swi yisa eka mana wakwe, kutani mana wa yena a lulamisa swakudya swo nandziha leswi tata wa Yakobo a a swi tsakela.	So he went and took them and brought them to his mother, and his mother prepared delicious food, such as his father loved.
Kutani Rhaveka a teka swiambalo leswo saseka swa Esawu n'wana wa yena lonkulu, a ambexa Yakobo n'wana wa yena lontsongo. Swiambalo leswi, Rhaveka a a ri na swona endlwini ya yena.	Then Rebekah took the best garments of Esau her older son, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob her younger son.
A teka ni madzovo ya swimbutana a tsondzela Yakobo emavokweni ni le nhan'wini ya yena yo pfumala ringhala.	And the skins of the young goats she put on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck.
Kutani Rhaveka a teka swakudya leswo nandziha leswi a swi lulamiseke a swi nyiketa Yakobo n'wana wa yena.	And she put the delicious food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.
Kutani Yakobo a ya nghena endlwini laha tata wa yena a a ri kona, a fika a ku: Tatana, yena a hlamula a ku: Hi mina loyi, xana hi wena mani n'wananga?	So he went in to his father and said, My father. And he said, Here I am. Who are you, my son?
Yakobo a hlamula tata wa yena a ku: Hi mina Esawu mativula ya wena. Ndzi endlile hilaha u ndzi leriseke hakona; pfuka u tshama u dya swa vuhloti bya mina leswaku u ta ndzi katekisa.	Jacob said to his father, I am Esau your firstborn. I have done as you told me; now sit up and eat of my game, that your soul may bless me.
Isaka a ku: Xana swi endlise ku yini leswaku u hatla u dlaya xiharhi xana? Yena a hlamula a ku: HOSI Xikwembu xa wena hi xona xi endleke leswaku ndzi hatla ndzi humelela.	But Isaac said to his son, How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son? He answered, Because the LORD your God granted me success.
Kutani Isaka a ku: N'wananga, tshinela ndzi ku ambamba, ndzi twa loko hakunene u ri yena Esawu n'wananga kumbe loko u nga ri yena.	Then Isaac said to Jacob, Please come near, that I may feel you, my son, to know whether you are really my son Esau or not.
Hiloko Yakobo a tshinela kusuhi ni tata wa yena Isaka, kutani Isaka a n'wi ambamba a ku: Rito i ra Yakobo, kambe mavoko i ya Esawu!	So Jacob went near to Isaac his father, who felt him and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.
Isaka a nga kotanga ku tiva Yakobo, hikuva mavoko ya yena a ma ri ni voya ku fana ni mavoko ya makwavo Esawu. Kutani Isaka a katekisa Yakobo.	And he did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like his brother Esau's hands. So he blessed him.
Isaka a vutisa a ku: Hakunene hi wena Esawu n'wananga xana? Yakobo a hlamula a ku: Hi mina.	He said, Are you really my son Esau? He answered, I am.
Kutani Isaka a ku: Ndzi nyikete swa vuhloti bya wena n'wananga, ndzi ta dya ndzi ku katekisa. Kutani Yakobo a n'wi nyiketa swona a dya; a tlhela a n'wi nyika vhinyo a nwa.	Then he said, Bring it near to me, that I may eat of my son's game and bless you. So he brought it near to him, and he ate; and he brought him wine, and he drank.
Kutani tata wa yena Isaka a ku: Tshinela u ndzi ntswontswa, n'wananga.	Then his father Isaac said to him, Come near and kiss me, my son.
Kutani Isaka a heta ku katekisa Yakobo. Loko Yakobo a ha ku suka eka tata wa yena, Esawu makwavo a vuya hi le ku hloteni.	As soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, when Jacob had scarcely gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, Esau his brother came in from his hunting.
Kutani na yena a lulamisa swakudya leswo nandziha, a swi yisa eka tata wa yena, a fika a ku ka yena: Tatana, pfuka u dya swa vuhloti bya mina n'wana wa wena, u ta ndzi katekisa.	He also prepared delicious food and brought it to his father. And he said to his father, Let my father arise and eat of his son's game, that you may bless me.
Tata wa yena a ku ka yena: Hi wena mani xana? Esawu a hlamula a ku: Hi mina Esawu n'wana wa wena wa mativula.	His father Isaac said to him, Who are you? He answered, I am your son, your firstborn, Esau.
Kutani Isaka a tshuka swinene, a ku: Xana i mani loyi a nga ya eku hloteni, a ndzi tisela swa vuhloti bya yena ndzi dya, wena u nga si vuya, ndzi tlhela ndzi n'wi katekisa xana? Munhu yoloye ú katekisiwile hakunene!	Then Isaac trembled very violently and said, Who was it then that hunted game and brought it to me, and I ate it all before you came, and I have blessed him? Yes, and he shall be blessed.
Loko Esawu a twa marito ya tata wakwe, a rila hi xiviti, a ba huwa leyikulu, kutani a ku ka tata wa yena: Tatana, na mina ndzi kombela leswaku u ndzi katekisa!	As soon as Esau heard the words of his father, he cried out with an exceedingly great and bitter cry and said to his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father!
Kambe yena a ku: Makwenu ú tile hi vukanganyisi, kutani ú tekile minkateko ya wena.	But he said, Your brother came deceitfully, and he has taken away your blessing.
Esawu a ku: Xana hileswi a thyiweke vito ra Yakobo xana? Sweswi i ravumbirhi a ri karhi a ndzi dyelela! Ú rhange a ndzi tekela vuhosi bya mina, kutani namuntlha ú tekile minkateko ya mina. Esawu a ya emahlweni a ku: Xana a wu ndzi siyelanga yin'wana minkateko xana?	Esau said, Is he not rightly named Jacob? For he has cheated me these two times. He took away my birthright, and behold, now he has taken away my blessing. Then he said, Have you not reserved a blessing for me?
Isaka a hlamula Esawu a ku: Vona, ndzi endlile leswaku wena u va hansi ka yena; vamakwavo wa yena hinkwavo, ndzi n'wi nyikile vona leswaku va va malandza ya yena. Ndzi n'wi nyikile ni mavele ni vhinyo. Kutani xana ka ha sele yini lexi ndzi nga ku endlelaka xona, we n'wananga xana?	Isaac answered and said to Esau, Behold, I have made him lord over you, and all his brothers I have given to him for servants, and with grain and wine I have sustained him. What then can I do for you, my son?
Esawu a ku ka tata wakwe: Tatana, xana wo kota ku katekisa kan'we ntsena xana? Tatana, na mina ndzi katekise. Kutani Esawu a rila a ba huwa.	Esau said to his father, Have you but one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice and wept.
Kutani Esawu a sungula ku venga Yakobo hikwalaho ka leswi tata wa yena a n'wi katekiseke. Esawu a vulavula a ri yexe a ku: Masiku ya ku rila tatana a ma ha ri kule, kutani ndzi ta dlaya lowa makwerhu Yakobo.	Now Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him, and Esau said to himself, The days of mourning for my father are approaching; then I will kill my brother Jacob.
Kambe van'wana va ya va ya byela Rhaveka leswi n'wana wa yena lonkulu a vuleke swona. Hiloko Rhaveka a rhuma munhu a ya vitana Yakobo n'wana wa yena lontsongo, kutani Rhaveka a ku ka yena: Vona, makwenu Esawu ú lava ku rheleta mbilu ya yena hi ku dlaya wena.	But the words of Esau her older son were told to Rebekah. So she sent and called Jacob her younger son and said to him, Behold, your brother Esau comforts himself about you by planning to kill you.
Kutani sweswi, yingisa leswi ndzi ku byelaka swona, we n'wananga: Suka u baleka u ya eka makwerhu Labani eHarani.	Now therefore, my son, obey my voice. Arise, flee to Laban my brother in Haran
U ta tshama kwale ka lowa makwerhu, ku kondza ku hlundzuka ka Esawu makwenu ku hela	and stay with him a while, until your brother's fury turns away
a rivala leswi u n'wi endleke swona. Loko ku hlundzuka ka yena ku herile, ndzi ta rhumela vanhu va ta ku teka u vuya. A ndzi lavi ku rila nkosi wa n'wina vambirhi hi siku rin'we!	until your brother's anger turns away from you, and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will send and bring you from there. Why should I be bereft of you both in one day?
Kutani Rhaveka a ku ka Isaka: Mina ndzi dyisiwa mbitsi hi vavasati lava va Vahiti. Loko na yena Yakobo o teka nsati wa Muhiti kwala tikweni leri, wo fana ni vavasati lava, xana ndza ha ta va ndzi hanyela yini xana?	Then Rebekah said to Isaac, I loathe my life because of the Hittite women. If Jacob marries one of the Hittite women like these, one of the women of the land, what good will my life be to me?
Kutani Isaka a vitana Yakobo a n'wi katekisa, a tlhela a n'wi laya a ku ka yena: U nga tshuki u teka nsati exikarhi ka vanhwanyana va Vakanana	Then Isaac called Jacob and blessed him and directed him, You must not take a wife from the Canaanite women.
Yana emutini wa Betuwele tata wa mana wa wena ePadani-Aramu, u ya teka un'wana wa vana va Labani makwavo wa mana wa wena, a va nsati wa wena.	Arise, go to Paddan-aram to the house of Bethuel your mother's father, and take as your wife from there one of the daughters of Laban your mother's brother.
Xikwembu-xa-matimba-hinkwawo a xi ku katekise, xi ku nyika vatukulu lavo tala swinene leswaku u va tata wa vanhu va ntsandza-vahlayi.	God Almighty bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you, that you may become a company of peoples.
Xikwembu a xi ku nyike minkateko ya Abrahama, wena ni vatukulu va wena, leswaku u teka tiko leri u luveleke eka rona ri va ra wena, ri nga tiko leri Xikwembu xi ri nyikeke Abrahama!	May he give the blessing of Abraham to you and to your offspring with you, that you may take possession of the land of your sojournings that God gave to Abraham!
Kavaloko Isaka a lelana na Yakobo, kutani Yakobo a ya ePadani-Aramu le ka Labani n'wana Betuwele lowa Muaramu. Labani a a ri makwavo wa Rhaveka mana wa Yakobo na Esawu.	Thus Isaac sent Jacob away. And he went to Paddan-aram, to Laban, the son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother.
Esawu a swi vona loko Isaka a katekisa Yakobo, a twa ni loko a n'wi lerisa ku ya ePadani-Aramu a ya teka nsati kona; naswona Esawu a twa Isaka loko a laya Yakobo a ku: U nga tshuki u teka nsati exikarhi ka vanhwanyana va Vakanana.	Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan-aram to take a wife from there, and that as he blessed him he directed him, You must not take a wife from the Canaanite women,
Nakambe loko Yakobo a yingisa tata wa yena ni mana wa yena a suka a ya ePadani-Aramu, Esawu a swi vona	and that Jacob had obeyed his father and his mother and gone to Paddan-aram.
a twisisa ni leswaku tata wa yena a nga tsakeri vanhwanyana va Vakanana.	So when Esau saw that the Canaanite women did not please Isaac his father
Hiloko a ya eka Iximaele a ya teka Mahalata N'wa-Iximaele wa Abrahama leswaku a va nsati wa yena, ehandle ka lava a a ri na vona. Mahalata a a ri makwavo wa Nebayoto.	Esau went to Ishmael and took as his wife, besides the wives he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham's son, the sister of Nebaioth.
Kutani Yakobo a suka eBerexeba a kongoma eHarani.	Jacob left Beersheba and went toward Haran.
Kutani a ya fika endhawini yin'wana a xwa kona hikuva dyambu a ri perile. Loko a etlela, a teka ribye rin'wana kwala ndhawini leyi a ri khegela.	And he came to a certain place and stayed there that night, because the sun had set. Taking one of the stones of the place, he put it under his head and lay down in that place to sleep.
Kutani a lorha ku ri na phandze leri dzimiweke emisaveni, makumu ya rona ma dliva tilo. Kutani a vona tintsumi ta Xikwembu, tin'wana ti ri karhi ti xika tin'wana ti ri karhi ti khandziya!	And he dreamed, and behold, there was a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven. And behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it!
HOSI Xikwembu a xi yimile etlhelo ka yena, kutani xi ku: Hi mina HOSI, Xikwembu xa Abrahama na Isaka. Tiko leri u etleleke eka rona ndzi ta ku nyika rona, wena ni vatukulu va wena.	And behold, the LORD stood above it and said, I am the LORD, the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac. The land on which you lie I will give to you and to your offspring.
Vatukulu va wena va ta tala ku fana ni ntshuri wa misava; mi ta hangalaka na tiko mi ya evupeladyambu, ni le vuxeni, ni le n'walungwini, ni le dzongeni. Vanhu hinkwavo laha misaveni va ta katekisiwa hikwalaho ka wena ni vatukulu va wena.	Your offspring shall be like the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south, and in you and your offspring shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
Vona, ndzi na wena; ndzi ta ku hlayisa hinkwako lomu u nga ta ya kona, ndzi tlhela ndzi ku vuyisa etikweni leri, hikuva ndzi nga ka ndzi nga ku tshiki ku kondza ndzi endla hinkwaswo leswi ndzi ku byeleke swona.	Behold, I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land. For I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.
Kutani Yakobo a phaphama evurhongweni, a ku: Hakunene HOSI Xikwembu xi kona endhawini leyi! Mina a ndzi nga swi tivi!	Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, Surely the LORD is in this place, and I did not know it.
Kutani a sungula ku chava a ku: Ndhawu leyi ya hlamarisa swinene! Leyi yo va yona yindlu ya Xikwembu, naswona yo va yona nyangwa ya tilo!	And he was afraid and said, How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.
Kutani Yakobo a pfuka nimpundzu swinene, a teka ribye leri a a ri khegerile, a ri yimisa leswaku ri ta va xitsundzuxo, a chela mafurha ehenhla ka rona.	So early in the morning Jacob took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up for a pillar and poured oil on the top of it.
Kutani ndhawu leyi a yi thya vito ra Betele (hileswaku: Yindlu-ya-Xikwembu). Khale ndhawu leyi a yi tiviwa hi vito ra Luzi.	He called the name of that place Bethel, but the name of the city was Luz at the first.
Kutani Yakobo a hlambanya a ku: Loko wena Xikwembu wo va na mina, u ndzi hlayisa eriendzweni leri ndzi nga ka rona, u ndzi nyika swakudya ni swiambalo	Then Jacob made a vow, saying, If God will be with me and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat and clothing to wear
ndzi kondza ndzi tlhelela emutini wa tatana hi ku rhula, wena HOSI u ta va Xikwembu xa mina.	so that I come again to my father's house in peace, then the LORD shall be my God
Ribye leri ra xitsundzuxo leri ndzi ri yimiseke, ri ta va yona yindlu ya wena Xikwembu. Eka hinkwaswo leswi u nga ta ndzi nyika swona, ndzi ta ku humesela vukhume bya swona.	and this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, shall be God's house. And of all that you give me I will give a full tenth to you.
Kutani Yakobo a ya emahlweni ni riendzo ra yena ku kondza a ya fika etikweni ra vanhu va le vuxeni.	Then Jacob went on his journey and came to the land of the people of the east.
Kuteloko a tlakusa mahlo, o vona xihlovo. Kusuhi ni xihlovo lexi, a ku ri ni mintlhambi minharhu ya tinyimpfu, hikuva exihlobyeni lexi, hi kona laha a ti kuma mati kona. Ribye leri a va funengeta ha rona xihlovo a ri kurile swinene.	As he looked, he saw a well in the field, and behold, three flocks of sheep lying beside it, for out of that well the flocks were watered. The stone on the well's mouth was large
Loko mintlhambi hinkwayo yi hlengeletanile, varisi a va khunguluxa ribye ri suka enon'wini wa xihlovo, va kelela mati va nwisa mintlhambi ya vona, kutani va tlhela va funengeta xihlovo hi ribye.	and when all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds would roll the stone from the mouth of the well and water the sheep, and put the stone back in its place over the mouth of the well.
Yakobo a ku ka vona: Vamakwerhu, xana mi huma kwihi xana? Vona va ku: Hi huma eHarani.	Jacob said to them, My brothers, where do you come from? They said, We are from Haran.
Yakobo a ku ka vona: Xana ma n'wi tiva Labani, ntukulu wa Nahoro xana? Vona va ku: Ha n'wi tiva.	He said to them, Do you know Laban the son of Nahor? They said, We know him.
Yakobo a ku ka vona: Xana wa ha pfukile xana? Vona va ku: Wa ha pfukile; vona, Rahele n'wana wa yena hi luya a taka ni tinyimpfu!	He said to them, Is it well with him? They said, It is well; and see, Rachel his daughter is coming with the sheep!
Yakobo a ku: Vonani, dyambu ra ha ri kona, a hi wona nkarhi wo hlengeleta swifuwo; nwisani tinyimpfu emati, kutani mi ti yisa emadyelweni.	He said, Behold, it is still high day; it is not time for the livestock to be gathered together. Water the sheep and go, pasture them.
Kambe vona va ku: Hi nga ka hi nga fambi loko mintlhambi hinkwayo yi nga si hlengeletana, leswaku hi ta khunguluxa ribye ri suka enon'wini wa xihlovo, hi nwisa tinyimpfu.	But they said, We cannot until all the flocks are gathered together and the stone is rolled from the mouth of the well; then we water the sheep.
Loko Yakobo a ha vulavula na vona, Rahele o ta a ta fika ni tinyimpfu ta tata wakwe, hikuva hi yena a a ti risa.	While he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep, for she was a shepherdess.
Kuteloko Yakobo a vona Rahele n'wana Labani makwavo wa mana wa yena, a ri ni tinyimpfu ta Labani, a ya a ya khunguluxa ribye ri suka enon'wini wa xihlovo, kutani a nwisa tinyimpfu ta Labani makwavo wa mana wa yena.	Now as soon as Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, Jacob came near and rolled the stone from the well's mouth and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.
Kutani Yakobo a ntswontswa Rahele, a tlhela a rila swinene.	Then Jacob kissed Rachel and wept aloud.
Kutani Yakobo a ku ka Rahele: Mina ndzi xaka ra tata wa wena, ndzi n'wana Rhaveka. Kutani Rahele a tsutsuma a ya tivisa tata wa yena.	And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's kinsman, and that he was Rebekah's son, and she ran and told her father.
Loko Labani a twa ta Yakobo n'wana makwavo wa yena, a tsutsuma a ya n'wi hlanganisa, a fika a n'wi vukarha a n'wi ntswontswa, kutani a n'wi yisa emutini wa yena. Kutani Yakobo a rungulela Labani hinkwaswo leswi humeleleke.	As soon as Laban heard the news about Jacob, his sister's son, he ran to meet him and embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his house. Jacob told Laban all these things
Kavaloko Labani a ku ka yena: Hakunene mina na wena hi nyama yin'we ni ngati yin'we. Kutani Yakobo a tshama n'hweti yin'we eka Labani.	and Laban said to him, Surely you are my bone and my flesh! And he stayed with him a month.
Kutani Labani a ku ka Yakobo: Xana u nga ndzi tirhela mahala hi mhaka ya leswi u nga xaka ra mina xana?	Then Laban said to Jacob, Because you are my kinsman, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what shall your wages be?
Labani a a ri ni vana vambirhi va vanhwanyana; lonkulu a a ri Leya, kasi lontsongo a a ri Rahele.	Now Laban had two daughters. The name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.
Leya a a ri ni mahlo lama tsaneke, kasi Rahele yena a a sasekile swinene a tlhela a va ni xivumbeko lexinene.	Leah's eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful in form and appearance.
Yakobo a a rhandza Rahele, kutani a ku ka Labani: Ndzi ta ku tirhela malembe ya 7 leswaku u ndzi nyika Rahele n'wana wa wena lontsongo.	Jacob loved Rachel. And he said, I will serve you seven years for your younger daughter Rachel.
Labani a ku: Yi ta va mhaka leyinene loko ndzi n'wi nyiketa eka wena, ku ri na ku n'wi nyiketa eka munhu un'wana; wena tshama kwala mutini wa mina.	Laban said, It is better that I give her to you than that I should give her to any other man; stay with me.
Kutani Yakobo a tirha malembe ya 7 leswaku a ta kuma Rahele. Eka Yakobo, malembe lawa a ma vonaka wonge mo va masiku ma nga ri mangani, hikuva a a rhandza Rahele swinene.	So Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they seemed to him but a few days because of the love he had for her.
Kutani Yakobo a ku ka Labani: Nkarhi lowu hi twananeke wona wu herile; ndzi kombela leswaku u ndzi hlomisela nsati wa mina.	Then Jacob said to Laban, Give me my wife that I may go in to her, for my time is completed.
Kutani Labani a endla nkhuvo, a rhamba vanhu hinkwavo va ndhawu yoleyo.	So Laban gathered together all the people of the place and made a feast.
Kambe madyambu wolawo, Labani a teka n'wana wa yena Leya a n'wi yisa eka Yakobo, kutani Yakobo a tivana na yena.	But in the evening he took his daughter Leah and brought her to Jacob, and he went in to her.
(Labani a teka ni nandza wa yena Zilipa a n'wi nyiketa eka Leya n'wana wa yena leswaku a ta va nandza wa yena.)	(Laban gave his female servant Zilpah to his daughter Leah to be her servant.)
Loko ri xa, Yakobo a kuma leswaku ú nyikiwile Leya, hiloko a vutisa Labani a ku: Xana i mhaka muni leyi u ndzi endleke yona xana? Xana leswi a ndzi ku tirhela, a ndzi nga tirheli ku kuma Rahele xana? Kutani ke, u ndzi kanganyisele yini xana?	And in the morning, behold, it was Leah! And Jacob said to Laban, What is this you have done to me? Did I not serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived me?
Labani a hlamula a ku: Laha tikweni ra ka hina a hi endlisi swona: Lontsongo a nga ka a nga rhangeli hosi ya yena a hloma.	Laban said, It is not so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn.
Wena yima ku hela vhiki leri ra nkhuvo wa loyi, kutani hi ta ku nyika lontsongo, kambe na yena u ta n'wi tirhela malembe ya 7.	Complete the week of this one, and we will give you the other also in return for serving me another seven years.
Yakobo a nkhensa, a yima ku kondza ku hela vhiki ra nkhuvo wa Leya. Kutani Labani a n'wi nyika n'wana wa yena Rahele leswaku a va nsati wa yena.	Jacob did so, and completed her week. Then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to be his wife.
(Labani a teka ni nandza wa yena Biliha a n'wi nyiketa eka Rahele n'wana wa yena leswaku a va nandza wa yena.)	(Laban gave his female servant Bilhah to his daughter Rachel to be her servant.)
Kutani Yakobo a tivana na Rahele, a n'wi rhandza ku tlula Leya, kutani a tlhela a tirhela Labani malembe ya 7.	So Jacob went in to Rachel also, and he loved Rachel more than Leah, and served Laban for another seven years.
Loko HOSI Xikwembu xi vona leswaku Leya wa vengiwa, xi endla leswaku a kuma vana. Rahele yena a a nga va kumi.	When the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb, but Rachel was barren.
Kutani Leya a tika, a veleka n'wana wa mufana, a n'wi thya vito ra Rhuveni (hileswaku: Vonani n'wana wa mufana), hikuva a a ku: HOSI Xikwembu xi vonile ku xaniseka ka mina; sweswi ndza tshemba leswaku nuna wa mina ú ta ndzi rhandza.	And Leah conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben, for she said, Because the LORD has looked upon my affliction; for now my husband will love me.
Leya a engeta a tika, a veleka n'wana wa mufana, kutani a ku: HOSI Xikwembu xi swi twile leswaku ndza vengiwa, kutani xi tlhela xi ndzi nyika n'wana un'wana wa mufana!, kutani a n'wi thya vito ra Simiyoni (hileswaku: Ku twa).	She conceived again and bore a son, and said, Because the LORD has heard that I am hated, he has given me this son also. And she called his name Simeon.
Leya a tlhela a tika nakambe, a veleka n'wana wa mufana, kutani a ku: Sweswi, nuna wa mina ú ta ndzi namarhela, hikuva ndzi n'wi velekerile majaha manharhu. Hikokwalaho a n'wi thya vito ra Levhi (hileswaku: Ku namarhela).	Again she conceived and bore a son, and said, Now this time my husband will be attached to me, because I have borne him three sons. Therefore his name was called Levi.
A tlhela a tika nakambe, a veleka n'wana wa mufana, kutani a ku: Sweswi ndzi ta dzunisa HOSI Xikwembu, hikokwalaho a n'wi thya vito ra Yuda (hileswaku: Ku dzunisa). Kutani Leya a yima ku veleka.	And she conceived again and bore a son, and said, This time I will praise the LORD. Therefore she called his name Judah. Then she ceased bearing.
Kuteloko Rahele a vona leswaku a nga kumi vana, a sungula ku vondzoka Leya, kutani a ku ka Yakobo: Ndzi nyike vana, loko swi nga ri tano, mina ndzi ta tidlaya!	When Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, she envied her sister. She said to Jacob, Give me children, or I shall die!
Kutani Yakobo a hlundzukela Rahele a ku ka yena: Xana mina ndzi nga tirha ntirho lowu tirhiwaka hi Xikwembu xana? Hi xona xi endleke leswaku u nga kumi vana!	Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel, and he said, Am I in the place of God, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?
Kutani Rahele a ku: Biliha nandza wa mina hi loyi, etlela na yena leswaku a ta ndzi velekela vana, lava nga ta va va mina.	Then she said, Here is my servant Bilhah; go in to her, so that she may give birth on my behalf, that even I may have children through her.
Hiloko Rahele a teka Biliha nandza wa yena a n'wi nyika Yakobo leswaku a va nsati wa yena. Kutani Yakobo a tivana na yena.	So she gave him her servant Bilhah as a wife, and Jacob went in to her.
Biliha a tika a velekela Yakobo n'wana wa mufana	And Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son.
kutani Rahele a ku: Xikwembu xi ndzi avanyisele mhaka, xi yingise xikombelo xa mina, kutani xi ndzi nyika n'wana wa mufana. Kutani Rahele a n'wi thya vito ra Dani (hileswaku: Ku avanyisela).	Then Rachel said, God has judged me, and has also heard my voice and given me a son. Therefore she called his name Dan.
Biliha nandza wa Rahele a engeta a tika nakambe, kutani a velekela Yakobo n'wana wa vumbirhi wa mufana	Rachel's servant Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son.
kutani Rahele a ku: Mina ni makwerhu Leya hi lwile ngopfu, kambe mina ndzi hlurile. Kutani n'wana loyi a n'wi thya vito ra Neftali (hileswaku: Ku lwa).	Then Rachel said, With mighty wrestlings I have wrestled with my sister and have prevailed. So she called his name Naphtali.
Kuteloko Leya a vona leswaku a nga ha kumi vana, a teka nandza wa yena Zilipa a n'wi nyika Yakobo leswaku a va nsati wa yena.	When Leah saw that she had ceased bearing children, she took her servant Zilpah and gave her to Jacob as a wife.
Hiloko Zilipa nandza wa Leya a velekela Yakobo n'wana wa mufana	Then Leah's servant Zilpah bore Jacob a son.
kutani Leya a ku: Ndzi katekile!, kutani a n'wi thya vito ra Gadi (hileswaku: Ku kateka).	And Leah said, Good fortune has come! so she called his name Gad.
Zilipa nandza wa Leya a engeta a velekela Yakobo n'wana wa vumbirhi wa mufana	Leah's servant Zilpah bore Jacob a second son.
kutani Leya a ku: Ndzi tsakile ngopfu! Vavasati va ta ndzi vitana munhu wa ntsako. Kutani a thya n'wana loyi vito ra Asere (hileswaku: Ntsako).	And Leah said, Happy am I! For women have called me happy. So she called his name Asher.
Enkarhini wa ku tshovela koroni, Rhuveni a ya emasin'wini, kutani a kuma marhanga ya rirhandzu; hiloko a muka na wona a ya nyika mana wa yena Leya. Kutani Rahele a ku ka Leya: Ndzi kombela leswaku u ndzi pambulela marhanga ya rirhandzu lawa n'wana wa wena a vuyeke na wona.	In the days of wheat harvest Reuben went and found mandrakes in the field and brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Please give me some of your son's mandrakes.
Kutani Leya a ku ka Rahele: Xana i mhaka yitsongo eka wena leswi u nga ndzi tekela nuna xana? Wa ha lava ni ku ndzi tekela marhanga ya rirhandzu ya n'wananga xana? Rahele a hlamula a ku: Loko wo ndzi pambulela marhanga ya rirhandzu ya n'wana wa wena, Yakobo a nga ta a ta etlela na wena vusiku bya namuntlha hikokwalaho ka marhanga ya n'wana wa wena.	But she said to her, Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband? Would you take away my son's mandrakes also? Rachel said, Then he may lie with you tonight in exchange for your son's mandrakes.
Madyambu wolawo loko Yakobo a vuya hi le masin'wini, Leya a n'wi hlanganisa a ku ka yena: U fanele ku ta u ta etlela na mina, hikuva ndzi ku xavile hi marhanga ya rirhandzu ya n'wananga. Kutani Yakobo a tivana na Leya vusiku byebyo.	When Jacob came from the field in the evening, Leah went out to meet him and said, You must come in to me, for I have hired you with my son's mandrakes. So he lay with her that night.
Kutani Xikwembu xi hlamula xikhongelo xa Leya, a tika, a velekela Yakobo n'wana wa mufana wa vuntlhanu.	And God listened to Leah, and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son.
Leya a ku: Xikwembu xi ndzi nyikile hakelo ya mina, hikuva ndzi nyiketile nandza wa mina eka nuna wa mina. Kutani n'wana loyi a n'wi thya vito ra Isakara (hileswaku: Hakelo).	Leah said, God has given me my wages because I gave my servant to my husband. So she called his name Issachar.
Kutani Leya a engeta a tika, a velekela Yakobo n'wana wa mufana wa vu-6.	And Leah conceived again, and she bore Jacob a sixth son.
Kutani Leya a ku: Xikwembu xi ndzi nyikile nyiko yo saseka, kutani nuna wa mina ú ta ndzi khoma kahle, hikuva ndzi n'wi velekerile majaha ya 6. Kutani a thya n'wana loyi vito ra Zebuloni (hileswaku: Nyiko kumbe Ku khoma kahle).	Then Leah said, God has endowed me with a good endowment; now my husband will honor me, because I have borne him six sons. So she called his name Zebulun.
Endzhaku ka sweswo, Leya a kuma n'wana wa nhwanyana, kutani a n'wi thya vito ra Dina.	Afterward she bore a daughter and called her name Dinah.
Kutani Xikwembu xi tsundzuka Rahele, xi hlamula xikhongelo xa yena, xi endla leswaku a kuma vana.	Then God remembered Rachel, and God listened to her and opened her womb.
Kutani a tika, a veleka n'wana wa mufana, kutani a ku: Xikwembu xi susile tingana ta mina.	She conceived and bore a son and said, God has taken away my reproach.
Kutani a n'wi thya vito ra Yosefa (hileswaku: Ku engeta), a ku: Mawaku loko HOSI yi nga engeta yi ndzi nyika n'wana un'wana wa mufana!	And she called his name Joseph, saying, May the LORD add to me another son!
Kuteloko Rahele a velekile Yosefa, Yakobo a ku ka Labani: Ndzi pfumelele ndzi famba ndzi ya eka hina etikweni ra rikwerhu.	As soon as Rachel had borne Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, Send me away, that I may go to my own home and country.
Ndzi nyike vasati va mina lava ndzi va tirheleke eka wena, u ndzi nyika ni vana va mina, kutani u ndzi tshika ndzi famba, hikuva ntirho lowu ndzi ku endleleke wona, wa wu tiva.	Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, that I may go, for you know the service that I have given you.
Kambe Labani a ku ka Yakobo: Yingisa ndzi ku byela: Ndzi hlahluvile ndzi kuma leswaku HOSI yi ndzi katekisile hikwalaho ka wena.	But Laban said to him, If I have found favor in your sight, I have learned by divination that the LORD has blessed me because of you.
Ndzi byele leswaku u lava ndzi ku hakela hi yini, ndzi ta ku nyika.	Name your wages, and I will give it.
Yakobo a ku ka Labani: Hi wena u tivaka hilaha ndzi ku tirheleke hakona, ni hilaha ndzi ku hlayiseleke swifuwo swa wena hakona.	Jacob said to him, You yourself know how I have served you, and how your livestock has fared with me.
Loko mina ndzi nga si fika, a wu ri ni swifuwo switsongo, kambe sweswi swi andzile ngopfu. HOSI yi ku katekisile eka hinkwaswo leswi a ndzi swi tirha, kambe mina ndzi ta sungula rini ku tirhela muti wa mina xana?	For you had little before I came, and it has increased abundantly, and the LORD has blessed you wherever I turned. But now when shall I provide for my own household also?
Labani a ku: Xana ndzi nga ku nyika yini xana? Yakobo a hlamula a ku: U nga ndzi nyiki nchumu! Mina ndzi nga ya emahlweni ndzi ku hlayisela ntlhambi wa wena, ndzi wu risa, kambe hi fanele ku twanana emhakeni leyi	He said, What shall I give you? Jacob said, You shall not give me anything. If you will do this for me, I will again pasture your flock and keep it
Namuntlha ndzi pfumelele ku nghena exikarhi ka ntlhambi wa wena hinkwawo, ndzi susetela tinyimpfu hinkwato leti nga ni mavalavala kumbe ta ntima, ndzi susa ni timbuti hinkwato ta mavalavala. Leyi hi yona hakelo ya mina.	let me pass through all your flock today, removing from it every speckled and spotted sheep and every black lamb, and the spotted and speckled among the goats, and they shall be my wages.
Siku u nga ta ta u ta vona leswi u ndzi hakeleke hi swona, ku tshembeka ka mina ku ta tikomba. Loko u kuma ndzi ri ni mbuti leyi yi nga riki na mavalavala, kumbe nyimpfu leyi nga riki ya ntima exikarhi ka ntlhambi, u swi hlaya swi ri leswi ndzi nga ta va ndzi lo swi yiva.	So my honesty will answer for me later, when you come to look into my wages with you. Every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and black among the lambs, if found with me, shall be counted stolen.
Labani a ku: Hiswona! A swi ve hilaha u vuleke hakona.	Laban said, Good! Let it be as you have said.
Kambe siku rero, Labani a hlawula swiphongho leswi nga ni mavalavala, ni mathokazi lama nga ni mavalavala, a swi susa exikarhi ka timbuti; a susa ni tinyimpfu ta ntima, kutani a swi nyiketa vana va yena leswaku va swi risa.	But that day Laban removed the male goats that were striped and spotted, and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white on it, and every lamb that was black, and put them in the charge of his sons.
Kutani Labani a tihambanyisa na Yakobo hi mpfhuka wo ringana riendzo ra masiku manharhu. Kutani Yakobo a risa ntlhambi lowun'wana wa Labani hinkwawo.	And he set a distance of three days' journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob pastured the rest of Laban's flock.
Kutani Yakobo a tsema minkhavi ya murhi wa nsihani ni wa alimondi ni wa xirhombe-rhombe, a yi kwamula byewu, a siya minkhwati-nkhwati yo basa.	Then Jacob took fresh sticks of poplar and almond and plane trees, and peeled white streaks in them, exposing the white of the sticks.
Kutani a teka minkhavi leyi a yi kwamuleke byewu, a ya yi veka emahlweni ka swifuwo, endzeni ka switsengele leswi swi nwelaka eka swona mati, hikuva swifuwo loko swi ta eku nweni ka mati a swi khandziyana.	He set the sticks that he had peeled in front of the flocks in the troughs, that is, the watering places, where the flocks came to drink. And since they bred when they came to drink
Kutani loko swifuwo swi khandziyana emahlweni ka minkhavi leyi, a swi tswala vana va mavalavala ni va minkhwati-nkhwati.	the flocks bred in front of the sticks and so the flocks brought forth striped, speckled, and spotted.
Kutani Yakobo a hambanyisa swinyimpfana leswi ni ntlhambi. Yakobo a tlhela a langutanisa tinyimpfu ta Labani ni leta minkhwati-nkhwati ni leta ntima, kutani hi ndlela leyi, Yakobo a tihlengeletela ntlhambi wa yena, a wu hambanyisa ni lowa ka Labani.	And Jacob separated the lambs and set the faces of the flocks toward the striped and all the black in the flock of Laban. He put his own droves apart and did not put them with Laban's flock.
Minkarhi hinkwayo loko swifuwo leswo tiya swi khandziyana, Yakobo a a veka minkhavi emahlweni ka swona endzeni ka switsengele leswaku swi khandziyana exikarhi ka minkhavi leyi.	Whenever the stronger of the flock were breeding, Jacob would lay the sticks in the troughs before the eyes of the flock, that they might breed among the sticks
Kambe swifuwo leswo tsana Yakobo a a nga swi vekeleli minkhavi, hikokwalaho leswo tsana swi va swa Labani, kasi leswo tiya swi va swa yena Yakobo.	but for the feebler of the flock he would not lay them there. So the feebler would be Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.
Hi ndlela leyi, Yakobo a va ni rifuwo lero tala swinene. A a ri ni mintlhambi leyikulu, ni malandza ya xinuna ni ya xisati, ni tikamela ni timbhongolo.	Thus the man increased greatly and had large flocks, female servants and male servants, and camels and donkeys.
Kutani Yakobo a twa leswaku vana va Labani va xinuna va ri: Yakobo ú tekile swilo hinkwaswo leswi a swi ri swa tatana; rifumo hinkwaro leri a nga na rona ú ri kuma eka tatana.	Now Jacob heard that the sons of Laban were saying, Jacob has taken all that was our father's, and from what was our father's he has gained all this wealth.
Yakobo a tlhela a swi vona leswaku Labani a nga ha n'wi tsakeli ku fana ni khale.	And Jacob saw that Laban did not regard him with favor as before.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Yakobo: Tlhelela etikweni ra rikwenu, eka va ka n'wina; mina ndzi ta va na wena.	Then the LORD said to Jacob, Return to the land of your fathers and to your kindred, and I will be with you.
Kutani Yakobo a rhuma vanhu va ya vitana Rahele na Leya leswaku va ta emadyelweni laha swifuwo swa yena a swi ri kona.	So Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah into the field where his flock was
Kutani a fika a ku ka vona: Ndza swi vona leswaku tata wa n'wina a nga ha ndzi tsakeli ku fana ni khale, kambe Xikwembu xa tatana xi na mina.	and said to them, I see that your father does not regard me with favor as he did before. But the God of my father has been with me.
Ma swi tiva leswaku ndzi tirhele tata wa n'wina hi matimba ya mina hinkwawo.	You know that I have served your father with all my strength
Hambiswiritano, tata wa n'wina ú ndzi kanganyisile, a hundzuluxa hakelo ya mina ka khume, kambe Xikwembu a xi n'wi pfumelelanga leswaku a ndzi vavisa.	yet your father has cheated me and changed my wages ten times. But God did not permit him to harm me.
Loko a ku: ‘Leswi swi nga ta va ni mavalavala entlhambini swi ta va swa wena’, ntlhambi hinkwawo a wu veleka swa mavalavala, ni loko a ku: ‘Leswi nga ni minkhwati-nkhwati swi ta va swona hakelo ya wena’, ntlhambi hinkwawo a wu veleka swa minkhwati-nkhwati.	If he said, 'The spotted shall be your wages,' then all the flock bore spotted; and if he said, 'The striped shall be your wages,' then all the flock bore striped.
Hi ndlela leyi, Xikwembu xi tekile swifuwo swa tata wa n'wina xi ndzi nyika swona.	Thus God has taken away the livestock of your father and given them to me.
Enkarhini wa ku mithisana ka swifuwo, ndzi lorhile ndzi vona swiphongho hinkwaswo leswi khandziyaka ntlhambi, swi ri swa mavalavala ni swa minkhwati-nkhwati.	In the breeding season of the flock I lifted up my eyes and saw in a dream that the goats that mated with the flock were striped, spotted, and mottled.
Kutani ntsumi ya Xikwembu yi vulavula na mina enorhweni yi ku: ‘Yakobo’, ndzi hlamula ndzi ku: ‘Hi mina loyi!’	Then the angel of God said to me in the dream, 'Jacob,' and I said, 'Here I am!'
Kutani yi ku: ‘Tlakusa mahlo u vona: Swiphongho hinkwaswo leswi khandziyaka ntlhambi i swa mavalavala ni swa minkhwati-nkhwati, hikuva hinkwaswo leswi Labani a ku endleke swona ndzi swi vonile.	And he said, 'Lift up your eyes and see, all the goats that mate with the flock are striped, spotted, and mottled, for I have seen all that Laban is doing to you.
Hi mina Xikwembu xa le Betele, kona laha wena u nga chela mafurha eribyeni ra xitsundzuxo, u tiboha emahlweni ka mina hi ku hlambanya. Kutani sweswi, suka laha tikweni u famba, u tlhelela etikweni leri u velekiweke eka rona.’ 	I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar and made a vow to me. Now arise, go out from this land and return to the land of your kindred.'
Kutani Rahele na Leya va ku: Xana emutini wa tatana ka ha sele nchumu lexi xi nga vaka ndzhaka ya hina xana?	Then Rachel and Leah answered and said to him, Is there any portion or inheritance left to us in our father's house?
Sweswi, tatana ú hi teka hi ri vanhu va le handle, hikuva ú hi xavisile, naswona ú dyile mali leyi hi xaviweke ha yona.	Are we not regarded by him as foreigners? For he has sold us, and he has indeed devoured our money.
Swilo hinkwaswo leswi Xikwembu xi nga swi tekela tata wa hina, i swa hina ni vana va hina. Kutani sweswi, hina hi ri, endla xin'wana ni xin'wana lexi Xikwembu xi ku byelaka xona.	All the wealth that God has taken away from our father belongs to us and to our children. Now then, whatever God has said to you, do.
Kutani Yakobo a teka vana va yena ni vasati va yena a va gadisa tikamela	So Jacob arose and set his sons and his wives on camels.
a byisa swifuwo swa yena hinkwaswo leswi a swi kumeke ePadani-Aramu, a tlhelela eka Isaka tata wa yena etikweni ra Kanana.	He drove away all his livestock, all his property that he had gained, the livestock in his possession that he had acquired in Paddan-aram, to go to the land of Canaan to his father Isaac.
Enkarhini wa kona Labani a a yile eku tsemeteni ka voya bya tinyimpfu ta yena, kutani Rahele n'wana wa yena a n'wi yivela swifaniso leswi vatliweke swa swikwembu.	Laban had gone to shear his sheep, and Rachel stole her father's household gods.
Yakobo ú kanganyisile Labani lowa Muaramu: A nga n'wi byelanga leswaku ú ta famba.	And Jacob tricked Laban the Aramean, by not telling him that he intended to flee.
Kutani a suka ni hinkwaswo leswi a a ri na swona, a baleka a tsemakanya nambu wa Yufrata, a kongoma emagangeni ya Giliyadi.	He fled with all that he had and arose and crossed the Euphrates, and set his face toward the hill country of Gilead.
Endzhaku ka masiku manharhu, Labani a twa leswaku Yakobo ú balekile.	When it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled
Kutani Labani a rhamba va ka vona, va landza Yakobo. Va hetile masiku ya 7 va ri karhi va n'wi landza, ku kondza va ya n'wi kuma emagangeni ya Giliyadi.	he took his kinsmen with him and pursued him for seven days and followed close after him into the hill country of Gilead.
Kutani Xikwembu xi ta hi norho eka Labani lowa Muaramu nivusiku, xi ku ka yena: Tivonele leswaku u nga tshuki u vula nchumu eka Yakobo, hambi xo biha kumbe xo saseka.	But God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream by night and said to him, Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.
Hiloko Labani a kuma Yakobo. Enkarhini lowu, Yakobo a a dzimile ntsonga wa yena emagangeni ya Giliyadi, kutani Labani ni va ka vona va fika va gova kwala magangeni ya Giliyadi.	And Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country, and Laban with his kinsmen pitched tents in the hill country of Gilead.
Kutani Labani a ku ka Yakobo: I mhaka muni leyi u yi endleke xana? U ndzi kanganyisile, u tlhela u teka vana va mina va xisati u famba na vona wonge vo va vanhu lava khomiweke enyimpini.	And Laban said to Jacob, What have you done, that you have tricked me and driven away my daughters like captives of the sword?
Hikwalaho ka yini u balekile kunene, u tlhela u ndzi kanganyisa xana? Hikwalaho ka yini u nga ndzi tivisanga xana? A ndzi ta va ndzi lelanile na wena hi ntsako, hi yimbelela hi chaya swingomana ni switende!	Why did you flee secretly and trick me, and did not tell me, so that I might have sent you away with mirth and songs, with tambourine and lyre?
Hikokwalaho ka yini u nga ndzi nyikanga nkarhi wo ntswontswa vatukulu va mina ni vana va mina xana? Mhaka leyi u yi endleke, i ya vuphukuphuku swinene!	And why did you not permit me to kiss my sons and my daughters farewell? Now you have done foolishly.
Ndzi na wona matimba yo ku twisa ku vava, kambe Xikwembu xa tata wa n'wina xi vulavule na mina vusiku bya tolo xi ku: ‘Tivonele leswaku u nga tshuki u vula nchumu eka Yakobo, hambi xo biha kumbe xo saseka.’	It is in my power to do you harm. But the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, 'Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.'
Ndza swi twisisa leswaku u sukile eka mina hikuva u navela va ka n'wina, kambe hikwalaho ka yini u yivile swikwembu swa mina xana?	And now you have gone away because you longed greatly for your father's house, but why did you steal my gods?
Kutani Yakobo a hlamula Labani a ku: Ndzi balekile, hikuva a ndzi chava leswaku u nga ala ni vana va wena va xisati, u ndzi tekela vona.	Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid, for I thought that you would take your daughters from me by force.
Munhu loyi u nga ta n'wi kuma a ri ni swikwembu swa wena, ú ta dlayiwa. Ndzi kombela leswaku u ndzi komba xilo xin'wana ni xin'wana lexi nga xa wena kwala mahlweni ka va ha hina, kutani u xi teka. Yakobo a a nga swi tivi leswaku Rahele ú yivile swifaniso leswi vatliweke swa swikwembu.	Anyone with whom you find your gods shall not live. In the presence of our kinsmen point out what I have that is yours, and take it. Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.
Kutani Labani a ya a ya nghena entsongeni wa Yakobo, ni le ntsongeni wa Leya, ni le ntsongeni wa vavasati lavambirhi va malandza, kambe a nga swi kumanga. Loko a huma entsongeni wa Leya, ú yile a ya nghena entsongeni wa Rahele.	So Laban went into Jacob's tent and into Leah's tent and into the tent of the two female servants, but he did not find them. And he went out of Leah's tent and entered Rachel's.
Rahele a a tekile swifaniso leswi vatliweke swa swikwembu a swi veka exitshan'wini lexi boheleriwaka ekameleni, kutani a tshama ehenhla ka swona. Labani ú fike a hangunuxa hinkwako entsongeni wa Rahele, kambe a nga swi kumanga.	Now Rachel had taken the household gods and put them in the camel's saddle and sat on them. Laban felt all about the tent, but did not find them.
Kutani Rahele a ku ka tata wa yena: We n'wini wanga, u nga tshuki u ndzi hlundzukela hi mhaka ya leswi ndzi nga sukiki ndzi yima loko ndzi ku vona, mhaka hi leswaku sweswi ndzi le masikwini ya mina. Kutani Labani a hangunuxa hinkwako, kambe a nga swi kumi swifaniso leswi vatliweke swa swikwembu.	And she said to her father, Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise before you, for the way of women is upon me. So he searched but did not find the household gods.
Kutani Yakobo a hlundzuka, a holovela Labani a ku: Nandzu wa mina hi wihi xana? Xana ndzi lo dyoha yini leswi u ndzi salaka ndzhaku xana?	Then Jacob became angry and berated Laban. Jacob said to Laban, What is my offense? What is my sin, that you have hotly pursued me?
Leswi u hangunuxeke tinhundzu ta mina hinkwato, xana u kumile yini lexi humaka eka tinhundzu ta wena hinkwato xana? Xilo xa kona xi veke laha mahlweni ka va ka hina ni va ka n'wina, va va vona va avanyisaka mhaka ya hina vambirhi.	For you have felt through all my goods; what have you found of all your household goods? Set it here before my kinsmen and your kinsmen, that they may decide between us two.
Ndzi vile na wena eka malembe ya 20 lama hundzeke, kambe tinyimpfu ta wena ni timbuti ta wena a ti fisanga ni siku ni rin'we; hambi ma ri makhuna ya ntlhambi wa wena a ndzi tlhavanga ni rin'we ra wona ndzi dya.	These twenty years I have been with you. Your ewes and your female goats have not miscarried, and I have not eaten the rams of your flocks.
Swifuwo leswi a swi dlayiwa hi swiharhi swa nhova, a ndzi nga vuyi na swona ndzi ta ku komba, kambe mina hi ndzexe a ndzi swi riha. Wena a wu ndzi rihisa ni loko swifuwo swi yiviwile ninhlekanhi kumbe nivusiku.	What was torn by wild beasts I did not bring to you. I bore the loss of it myself. From my hand you required it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.
Masiku hinkwawo, dyambu a ri tlanga hi mina, kasi nivusiku xirhami a xi ndzi dlaya, vurhongo byi hangalaka hinkwabyo.	There I was: by day the heat consumed me, and the cold by night, and my sleep fled from my eyes.
Ndzi tshamile na wena malembe ya 20: Ndzi ku tirherile malembe ya 14 leswaku u ndzi nyika vana va wena vambirhi va vanhwanyana, kasi eka lawa ya 6, a ndzi ku risela swifuwo swa wena, kambe u hundzuluxile hakelo ya mina ka khume.	These twenty years I have been in your house. I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times.
Loko Xikwembu xa tatana, xona Xikwembu xa Abrahama lexi Isaka a xi chavaka, a xi nga yimanga na mina, wena a wu ta va u ndzi hlongorile ndzi suka eka wena ndzi nga ri na nchumu. Xikwembu xi vonile ku xaniseka ka mina, ni leswi a ndzi tirha swona eka wena, kutani vusiku bya tolo xi ku tshinya.	If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been on my side, surely now you would have sent me away empty-handed. God saw my affliction and the labor of my hands and rebuked you last night.
Kutani Labani a hlamula Yakobo a ku: Lava i vana va mina va xisati, hambi va ri vana va vona i va mina, ni mintlhambi leyi i ya mina. Hinkwaswo leswi u swi vonaka i swa mina. Kambe sweswi ndza swi vona leswaku a ku na nchumu lexi ndzi nga xi endlaka hi tlhelo ra vana lava va mina ni vana va vona.	Then Laban answered and said to Jacob, The daughters are my daughters, the children are my children, the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine. But what can I do this day for these my daughters or for their children whom they have borne?
Hikokwalaho, tana hi ta endla ntwanano wa xinakulobye lowu nga ta va xitsundzuxo exikarhi ka mina na wena.	Come now, let us make a covenant, you and I. And let it be a witness between you and me.
Kutani Yakobo a teka ribye a ri yimisa, leswaku ri ta va ra xitsundzuxo.	So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar.
Kutani Yakobo a ku ka va ka vona: Hlengeletani maribye. Kutani va hlengeleta maribye ma endla nhulu. Hiloko va dyela swakudya kwala tlhelo ka maribye lawa.	And Jacob said to his kinsmen, Gather stones. And they took stones and made a heap, and they ate there by the heap.
Kutani Labani a thya nhulu leyi vito ra Yegara-Sahaduta, kasi Yakobo yena a yi thya vito ra Galede.	Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed.
Labani a ku: Nhulu leyi, i xitsundzuxo exikarhi ka mina na wena. Hikokwalaho yi thyiwa vito ra Galede (hileswaku: Nhulu ya xitsundzuxo).	Laban said, This heap is a witness between you and me today. Therefore he named it Galeed
Vito rin'wana leri yi thyiweke rona i Mispa (hileswaku: Ku languta), hikuva Labani a a ku: Loko hi hambanile, HOSI yi ta va yona yi hi languteke.	and Mizpah, for he said, The LORD watch between you and me, when we are out of one another's sight.
Loko wo xanisa vana lava va mina va xisati, kumbe u teka vasati van'wana ehandle ka vona, swi tive leswaku hambiloko ndzi nga ri kona, Xikwembu hi xona mbhoni ya mina.	If you oppress my daughters, or if you take wives besides my daughters, although no one is with us, see, God is witness between you and me.
Kutani Labani a ku ka Yakobo: Wa yi vona nhulu leyi ya maribye, ni ribye ra xitsundzuxo leri ndzi ri yimiseke!	Then Laban said to Jacob, See this heap and the pillar, which I have set between you and me.
Nhulu leyi, ni ribye leri, swi ta hi tsundzuxa leswaku hi nga swi tluli. Mina ndzi nge tluli nhulu leyi ndzi ta eka wena ndzi ta ku vavisa, kasi na wena u nge tluli nhulu leyi ni ribye leri u ta eka mina u ta ndzi vavisa.	This heap is a witness, and the pillar is a witness, that I will not pass over this heap to you, and you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, to do harm.
Xikwembu xa Abrahama, ni Xikwembu xa Nahoro, a swi ve swona leswi nga ta hi avanyisa. Kutani Yakobo a hlambanya emahlweni ka Xikwembu lexi Isaka tata wa yena a xi chavaka.	The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us. So Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac
Hiloko Yakobo a humesa magandzelo entshaveni, a vitana va ka vona va ya dya swakudya, kutani va xwa kona vusiku byebyo.	and Jacob offered a sacrifice in the hill country and called his kinsmen to eat bread. They ate bread and spent the night in the hill country.
Kutani Labani a pfuka ka ha ri mpundzu swinene, a ntswontswa vatukulu va yena ni vana va yena va xisati, a tlhela a va kombelela minkateko, kutani a tlhelela ekaya.	Early in the morning Laban arose and kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them. Then Laban departed and returned home.
Yakobo a ya emahlweni ni riendzo ra yena, kutani tintsumi ta Xikwembu ti n'wi hlanganisa.	Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.
Kuteloko Yakobo a ti vona, a ku: Lowu i nxaxa wa Xikwembu, kutani a thya ndhawu leyi vito ra Mahanayimi (hileswaku: Mixaxa mimbirhi).	And when Jacob saw them he said, This is God's camp! So he called the name of that place Mahanaim.
Kutani Yakobo a rhuma vanhu eka Esawu makwavo wa yena le Seyira, etikweni ra Edomu	And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother in the land of Seir, the country of Edom
a va lerisa ku ya byela Esawu marito lawa: We n'wini wanga, mina nandza wa wena a ndzi luverile eka Labani, ndzi tshame kona ku fika sweswi.	instructing them, Thus you shall say to my lord Esau: Thus says your servant Jacob, 'I have sojourned with Laban and stayed until now.
Kutani ndzi ni tihomu ni timbhongolo, ni swifuwo leswitsongo, ni malandza ya xinuna ni ya xisati, kutani ndzi rhuma vanhu lava ku ta ku tivisa mhaka leyi, we n'wini wanga, leswaku u ta ndzi amukela.	I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, male servants, and female servants. I have sent to tell my lord, in order that I may find favor in your sight.'
Kutani varhumiwa va tlhelela eka Yakobo va fika va ku ka yena: Hi fikile eka Esawu makwenu, kutani yena ni vavanuna va 400 va karhi va ta va ta ku hlanganisa.	And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to your brother Esau, and he is coming to meet you, and there are four hundred men with him.
Kutani Yakobo a chava swinene, a sungula ku rhurhumela, kutani a avanyisa vanhu lava a a ri na vona, ni swifuwo leswitsongo ni leswikulu, ni tikamela, ku huma mintlawa mimbirhi	Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed. He divided the people who were with him, and the flocks and herds and camels, into two camps
hikuva a a ku: Loko Esawu o fika a herisa ntlawa wun'we, lowun'wana wu ta pona.	thinking, If Esau comes to the one camp and attacks it, then the camp that is left will escape.
Kutani Yakobo a khongela a ku: We Xikwembu xa Abrahama kokwa wa mina ni xa Isaka tata wa mina, we HOSI, u ndzi byerile u ku: ‘Tlhelela eka n'wina etikweni ra rikwenu, kutani mina ndzi ta ku endlela leswinene.’	And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, O LORD who said to me, 'Return to your country and to your kindred, that I may do you good,'
Mina nandza wa wena a ndzi nga fanelanga ku kuma rirhandzu ra wena lero tshembeka, ni tintswalo hinkwato leti u ndzi kombeke tona. Loko ndzi pela nambu lowu wa Yordani, a ndzi khomile nhonga ntsena, kambe sweswi ndzi ni mintlawa mimbirhi.	I am not worthy of the least of all the deeds of steadfast love and all the faithfulness that you have shown to your servant, for with only my staff I crossed this Jordan, and now I have become two camps.
Ndzi kombela leswaku u ndzi lamulela eka makwerhu Esawu, hikuva ndzi chava leswaku a nga ta a ta hi herisa hinkwerhu, a herisa ni vavasati ni vana va vona.	Please deliver me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I fear him, that he may come and attack me, the mothers with the children.
Wena u ndzi byerile u ku: ‘Ndzi ta ku endlela leswinene, ndzi ku nyika vatukulu lavo tala ku fana ni sava ra lwandle leri nga hlayekiki.’ 	But you said, 'I will surely do you good, and make your offspring as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.'
Yakobo a xwa vusiku kona, kutani a pambula swilo swin'wana swa leswi a a ri na swona, leswaku swi ta nyikiwa Esawu makwavo wa yena.	So he stayed there that night, and from what he had with him he took a present for his brother Esau
Ú pamburile leswi: Timbuti ta mathokazi ta 200, ni swiphongho swa 20, ni tinyimpfu ta mathokazi ta 200, ni makhuna ya 20	two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams
ni tikamela ta mantswele ta 30 ni vana va tona, ni tihomu ta mantswele ta 40, ni tinkuzi ta 10, ni timbhongolo ta mantswele ta 20, ni timbhongolo ta tinkuzi ta 10.	thirty milking camels and their calves, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys.
Swifuwo leswi a swi avanyisa hi mintlhambi, kutani a swi veka emavokweni ya malandza ya yena, a ku ka vona: Rhangani emahlweni ka mina, kambe mi siya mpfhukanyana exikarhi ka ntlhambi wun'wana ni wun'wana.	These he handed over to his servants, every drove by itself, and said to his servants, Pass on ahead of me and put a space between drove and drove.
Yakobo a lerisa loyi a a rhangile emahlweni ka vona hinkwavo a ku: Loko makwerhu Esawu a ku hlanganisa, kutani a vutisa a ku: ‘U nandza wa mani xana? U ya kwihi xana? Swifuwo leswi u nga na swona i swa mani xana?’	He instructed the first, When Esau my brother meets you and asks you, 'To whom do you belong? Where are you going? And whose are these ahead of you?'
wena u fanele ku hlamula u ku: ‘I swa Yakobo nandza wa wena; i nyiko leyi tisiwaka eka wena n'wini wanga Esawu. Loko a ri yena Yakobo, wa karhi wa ta.’ 	then you shall say, 'They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a present sent to my lord Esau. And moreover, he is behind us.'
Yakobo a lerisa nandza wa vumbirhi ni lowa vunharhu, ni hinkwawo lawa a ma byisa mintlhambi a ku: Loko mi hlangana na Esawu, na n'wina mi fanele ku vula marito wolawo.	He likewise instructed the second and the third and all who followed the droves, You shall say the same thing to Esau when you find him
Mi tlhela mi ku: ‘Yakobo nandza wa wena wa karhi wa ta.’  Yakobo a a ehleketa leswaku u ta tsakisa Esawu hi tinyiko leti a a ti rhangisile, kutani yena hi xiviri ú ta ya vonana na Esawu endzhaku, hikuva a a ku: Kumbexana ú ta ndzi amukela.	and you shall say, 'Moreover, your servant Jacob is behind us.' For he thought, I may appease him with the present that goes ahead of me, and afterward I shall see his face. Perhaps he will accept me.
Kutani tinyiko ti rhanga emahlweni, kambe vusiku byebyo, yena a xwa enxaxeni.	So the present passed on ahead of him, and he himself stayed that night in the camp.
Vusiku byebyo, Yakobo a teka vasati va yena lavambirhi, ni malandza ya yena, ni vana va yena lava 11, va suka va famba va ya tsemakanya hi le hlalukweni ra nambu wa Yaboko.	The same night he arose and took his two wives, his two female servants, and his eleven children, and crossed the ford of the Jabbok.
Kutani Yakobo a fika a rhangisa vona va tsemakanya nambu, a rhangisa ni hinkwaswo leswi a a ri na swona	He took them and sent them across the stream, and everything else that he had.
kambe yena a sala a ri yexe. Kutani ku humelela munhu un'wana a fika a pfinyana na yena ku kondza ri xa.	And Jacob was left alone. And a man wrestled with him until the breaking of the day.
Loko munhu loyi a vona leswaku wa tsandzeka ku hlula Yakobo hi ku pfinyana na yena, o n'wi ba nyonga yi suleka.	When the man saw that he did not prevail against Jacob, he touched his hip socket, and Jacob's hip was put out of joint as he wrestled with him.
Kutani munhu loyi a ku: Ndzi tshike ndzi famba, hikuva ri lava ku xa. Kambe Yakobo a ku: Ndzi nge ku tshiki loko u nga si ndzi katekisa.	Then he said, Let me go, for the day has broken. But Jacob said, I will not let you go unless you bless me.
Munhu loyi a ku ka yena: Hi wena mani xana? Yena a ku: Hi mina Yakobo.	And he said to him, What is your name? And he said, Jacob.
Kutani a ku: Vito ra wena a ri nga ha vi Yakobo, kambe u ta va Israele, hikuva u pfinyanile ni Xikwembu ni vanhu, kambe u hlurile.	Then he said, Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel, for you have striven with God and with men, and have prevailed.
Kutani Yakobo a ku ka yena: Ndzi kombela leswaku u ndzi byela vito ra wena. Kambe yena a ku: Xana u vutisela yini vito ra mina xana? Kutani a katekisa Yakobo.	Then Jacob asked him, Please tell me your name. But he said, Why is it that you ask my name? And there he blessed him.
Hikokwalaho, Yakobo a thya ndhawu leyi vito ra Penuwele (hileswaku: Mombo-wa-Xikwembu), hikuva a a ku: Ndzi vonile mombo wa Xikwembu, kambe ndza ha hanya.	So Jacob called the name of the place Peniel, saying, For I have seen God face to face, and yet my life has been delivered.
Loko dyambu ri huma, Yakobo a suka ePenuwele, a ri karhi a khwita hikwalaho ka ku suriwa nyonga.	The sun rose upon him as he passed Penuel, limping because of his hip.
Hikokwalaho, ku fika ninamuntlha Vaisraele a va dyi nsiha wa le nyongeni, hikuva Yakobo u biwile ehenhla ka nsiha wa nyonga.	Therefore to this day the people of Israel do not eat the sinew of the thigh that is on the hip socket, because he touched the socket of Jacob's hip on the sinew of the thigh.
Kuteloko Yakobo a tlakusa mahlo, o vona Esawu a ri karhi a ta ni vavanuna va 400. Kutani Yakobo a hambanyisa vana va Leya, ni vana va Rahele, ni vana va malandza ya yena lamambirhi.	And Jacob lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, Esau was coming, and four hundred men with him. So he divided the children among Leah and Rachel and the two female servants.
Kutani emahlweni a veka malandza ni vana va wona, ku landza Leya ni vana va yena, kutani Rahele na Yosefa va va vo hetelela eka hinkwavo.	And he put the servants with their children in front, then Leah with her children, and Rachel and Joseph last of all.
Yakobo yena a rhanga emahlweni ka vona hinkwavo. Ku suka kwalaho, Yakobo ú nkhinsamile ka 7, ku kondza a ya fika eka makwavo Esawu.	He himself went on before them, bowing himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.
Kutani Esawu a tsutsuma a ya hlanganisa Yakobo, a fika a n'wi khoma a n'wi vukarha, a n'wi ntswontswa, kutani havambirhi va rila.	But Esau ran to meet him and embraced him and fell on his neck and kissed him, and they wept.
Kuteloko Esawu a tlakusa mahlo, o vona vavasati ni vana, kutani a ku: Lava u nga na vona i vamani xana? Yakobo a ku: I vana lava Xikwembu xi ndzi nyikeke vona mina nandza wa wena, hikwalaho ka tintswalo ta xona.	And when Esau lifted up his eyes and saw the women and children, he said, Who are these with you? Jacob said, The children whom God has graciously given your servant.
Kutani malandza ni vana va wona va tshinela va fika va nkhinsama	Then the servants drew near, they and their children, and bowed down.
Leya ni vana va yena, na vona va tshinela va fika va nkhinsama; eku heteleleni Yosefa na Rahele na vona va tshinela va fika va nkhinsama.	Leah likewise and her children drew near and bowed down. And last Joseph and Rachel drew near, and they bowed down.
Kutani Esawu a ku: Xana ntlawa wa wena lowu ndzi hlanganeke na wona i wa ku endla yini xana? Yakobo a ku: I wa ku endla leswaku wena n'wini wanga u ndzi amukela.	Esau said, What do you mean by all this company that I met? Jacob answered, To find favor in the sight of my lord.
Kambe Esawu a ku: Makwerhu, mina ndzi ni swilo swo ringana; leswi u nga na swona, tihlayisele swona.	But Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep what you have for yourself.
Yakobo a ku: E-e, loko u ndzi amukela hakunene, ndzi kombela leswaku u teka tinyiko leti ndzi ku nyikaka tona. Leswi ndzi voneke mombo wa wena, swi fana ni loko ndzi vonile mombo wa Xikwembu, hikuva u ndzi amukerile hi malwandla.	Jacob said, No, please, if I have found favor in your sight, then accept my present from my hand. For I have seen your face, which is like seeing the face of God, and you have accepted me.
Ndzi kombela leswaku u amukela tinyiko ta mina leti tisiweke eka wena, hikuva Xikwembu xi vile ni tintswalo eka mina, naswona ndzi ni swilo swo ringana. Hi ndlela leyi, Yakobo a khongotela Esawu ku kondza a teka tinyiko.	Please accept my blessing that is brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. Thus he urged him, and he took it.
Kutani Esawu a ku: A hi fambe, mina ndzi ta ku rhangela emahlweni.	Then Esau said, Let us journey on our way, and I will go ahead of you.
Kambe Yakobo a ku ka Esawu: We n'wini wanga, wa swi tiva leswaku vana a va si tiyela, naswona ndzi fanele ku hlenga swifuwo leswikulu ni leswitsongo leswa ha mamisaka, hikuva loko swi nga byisiwa siku hinkwaro, swi famba mpfhuka wo leha, swi nga fa hinkwaswo.	But Jacob said to him, My lord knows that the children are frail, and that the nursing flocks and herds are a care to me. If they are driven hard for one day, all the flocks will die.
We n'wini wanga, ndzi kombela leswaku u pfa u rhanga, mina nandza wa wena ndzi ta ta ndzi ri karhi ndzi byisa swifuwo khwatsi, ndzi famba ntsena mpfhuka lowu nga kotiwaka hi swifuwo ni vana lava ndzi nga na vona, ku kondza ndzi ta fika eka wena n'wini wanga le Seyira.	Let my lord pass on ahead of his servant, and I will lead on slowly, at the pace of the livestock that are ahead of me and at the pace of the children, until I come to my lord in Seir.
Kutani Esawu aku: Yima ndzi ku siyela van'wana va vavanuna lava ndzi nga na vona. Kambe Yakobo a ku: E-e, n'wini wanga, u nga kali u tikarhata! Mina ndzo nkhensa ntsena leswi u ndzi amukeleke, we n'wini wanga.	So Esau said, Let me leave with you some of the people who are with me. But he said, What need is there? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord.
Kutani hi siku rero Esawu a tlhelela eSeyira.	So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.
Kambe Yakobo yena a ya eSukoti, a fika a tiakela yindlu, a aka ni swivala swa swifuwo, hikokwalaho ndhawu leyi yi thyiwa vito ra Sukoti (hileswaku: Swivala).	But Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built himself a house and made booths for his livestock. Therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.
Loko Yakobo a ta a huma hi le Padani-Aramu, ú fikile hi ku rhula emutini wa Xikeme, etikweni ra Kanana, kutani a gova kusuhi ni muti lowu.	And Jacob came safely to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, on his way from Paddan-aram, and he camped before the city.
Kutani Yakobo a humesa mali ya tisilivhere ta 100 a nyika vana va Hamoro tata wa Xikeme, a xava ndhawu leyi a a dzimile ntsonga eka yona.	And from the sons of Hamor, Shechem's father, he bought for a hundred pieces of money the piece of land on which he had pitched his tent.
Kutani Yakobo a aka ni alitari, a yi thya vito ra Eli-Elohe-Israele (hileswaku: Xikwembu-xona-Xikwembu-xa-Israele).	There he erected an altar and called it El-Elohe-Israel.
Siku rin'wana, Dina n'wana Leya na Yakobo a huma a endzela vanhwanyana va tiko ra Kanana.	Now Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she had borne to Jacob, went out to see the women of the land.
Kuteloko Xikeme a n'wi vona, o n'wi pfinya a etlela na yena, a n'wi nyamisa. Xikeme a a ri n'wana Muhivhi loyi a va ku i Hamoro, yena ndhuna ya ndhawu yoleyo.	And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her, he seized her and lay with her and humiliated her.
Kambe Dina N'wa-Yakobo a yiva mbilu ya Xikeme, hiloko Xikeme a sungula ku rhandza Dina, a vulavula na yena kahle.	And his soul was drawn to Dinah the daughter of Jacob. He loved the young woman and spoke tenderly to her.
Kutani Xikeme a ya vulavula na Hamoro tata wa yena a ku: Ndzi kombela leswaku u ya ndzi tekela nhwanyana loyi, a ta va nsati wa mina.	So Shechem spoke to his father Hamor, saying, Get me this girl for my wife.
Mhaka ya ku nyamisiwa ka Dina yi ya yi ya fika etindleveni ta Yakobo tata wa yena. Enkarhini lowu, vana va Yakobo va xinuna a va ri eku riseni ka swifuwo swa yena enhoveni, hikokwalaho Yakobo a tikhoma ku kondza va vuya.	Now Jacob heard that he had defiled his daughter Dinah. But his sons were with his livestock in the field, so Jacob held his peace until they came.
Kutani Hamoro tata wa Xikeme a ya eka Yakobo ku ya vulavula na yena.	And Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to speak with him.
Vana va Yakobo va xinuna va lo na twa mhaka leyi, va vuya hi le nhoveni va nyangatsekile va tlhela va hlundzuka swinene, hikuva Xikeme a a nghenisile mhaka ya vuphukuphuku exikarhi ka Vaisraele hi ku etlela na n'wana Yakobo. Mhaka yo tano, a yi yila.	The sons of Jacob had come in from the field as soon as they heard of it, and the men were indignant and very angry, because he had done an outrageous thing in Israel by lying with Jacob's daughter, for such a thing must not be done.
Hamoro a vulavula na vana va Yakobo a ku: Xikeme n'wananga ú rhandza n'wana wa ka n'wina. Ndzi kombela leswaku mi n'wi pfumelela a tekiwa hi Xikeme.	But Hamor spoke with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longs for your daughter. Please give her to him to be his wife.
A hi twananeni leswaku vana va hina va tekana: Pfumelelani vana va n'wina va xisati ku tekiwa erixakeni ra ka hina, kasi na hina hi ta pfumelela lava ka hina ku tekiwa eka n'wina.	Make marriages with us. Give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves.
N'wina tshamani kwala xikarhi ka hina, a mi siveriwi ku va laha tikweni leri; tshamani, mi xava ni ku xavisa swilo, mi tlhela mi tikumela leswi nga ta va ndzhaka ya n'wina.	You shall dwell with us, and the land shall be open to you. Dwell and trade in it, and get property in it.
Na yena Xikeme a ya a ya vulavula na tata wa Dina ni vamakwavo wa yena a ku: Ndzi kombela leswaku mi ndzi amukela. Xin'wana ni xin'wana lexi mi nga ta xi vula, ndzi ta mi nyika xona.	Shechem also said to her father and to her brothers, Let me find favor in your eyes, and whatever you say to me I will give.
Vulani ntsengo wihi ni wihi lowu mi wu lavaka, ni tinyiko leti mi ti lavaka, ndzi ta humesa hilaha mi nga ta vula hakona, ntsena n'wina pfumelani leswaku ndzi teka n'wana wa n'wina.	Ask me for as great a bride-price and gift as you will, and I will give whatever you say to me. Only give me the young woman to be my wife.
Kutani vana va Yakobo va hlamula Xikeme na tata wa yena Hamoro hi ndlela yo kanganyisa, hikuva Xikeme a a nyamisile Dina makwavo wa vona	The sons of Jacob answered Shechem and his father Hamor deceitfully, because he had defiled their sister Dinah.
va ku ka vona: Sweswo, hi nga ka hi nga swi endli! Hi nge pfumeli leswaku makwerhu a tekiwa hi munhu wo ka a nga yimbanga. Mhaka yo tano, yi nga va tingana eka hina.	They said to them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised, for that would be a disgrace to us.
Hi nga pfumela ntsena loko ho twanana eka mhaka leyi: Pfumelani leswaku mi ta fana na hina, wanuna un'wana ni un'wana wa ka n'wina a yimbisiwa.	Only on this condition will we agree with you—that you will become as we are by every male among you being circumcised.
Kutani hi kona hi nga pfumelelaka vana va ka hina va xisati va tekiwa eka n'wina, na hina hi ta teka vana va n'wina va xisati, kutani hi ta tshama swin'we, hi va vanhu van'we.	Then we will give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters to ourselves, and we will dwell with you and become one people.
Kambe loko mi nga pfumeli ku yimbisiwa, n'wana wa ka hina hi ta n'wi teka hi famba na yena.	But if you will not listen to us and be circumcised, then we will take our daughter, and we will be gone.
Marito ya vana va Yakobo ma tsakisa Hamoro na n'wana wa yena Xikeme.	Their words pleased Hamor and Hamor's son Shechem.
Kutani jaha leri Xikeme ri hatlisa ri endla leswi vuriweke, hikuva a ri rhandza n'wana Yakobo swinene. Endyangwini wa ka vona, Xikeme hi yena a a xiximiwa ngopfu.	And the young man did not delay to do the thing, because he delighted in Jacob's daughter. Now he was the most honored of all his father's house.
Loko Hamoro na n'wana wa yena Xikeme va fika enyangweni ya muti wa ka vona, va vulavula ni vaaki va muti, va ku	So Hamor and his son Shechem came to the gate of their city and spoke to the men of their city, saying
Vanhu lava, a va holovi na hina! Va pfumeleleni va tshama laha tikweni, va xava swilo ni ku xavisa eka rona. Tiko leri, ma ri vona i rikulu, ri nga va ringana. A hi tekeni vana va vona va xisati, na hina hi pfumelela vana va hina va xisati va tekiwa eka vona.	These men are at peace with us; let them dwell in the land and trade in it, for behold, the land is large enough for them. Let us take their daughters as wives, and let us give them our daughters.
Vanhu lava, va nga nkhensa ku tshama na hina, hi va vanhu van'we, kambe hi fanele ku pfumela leswaku wanuna un'wana ni un'wana exikarhi ka hina a yimbisiwa, ku fana na vona leswi va yimbeke.	Only on this condition will the men agree to dwell with us to become one people—when every male among us is circumcised as they are circumcised.
A hi pfumeleni leswi va swi vulaka leswaku va ta tshama swin'we na hina, kutani swifuwo swa vona ni swilo swa vona hinkwaswo swi ta va swa hina.	Will not their livestock, their property and all their beasts be ours? Only let us agree with them, and they will dwell with us.
Kutani vavanuna hinkwavo lava yeke enyangweni ya muti, va pfumela leswi vuriweke hi Hamoro ni n'wana wa yena Xikeme. Kutani wanuna un'wana ni un'wana loyi a yeke enyangweni ya muti, a yimbisiwa.	And all who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor and his son Shechem, and every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city.
Hi siku ra vunharhu, loko vavanuna lava va ha twa ku vava, vana vambirhi va Yakobo, Simiyoni na Levhi, vona vamakwavo wa Dina, va teka mafumu ya vona va ya hlasela muti, vaaki va wona va nga ehleketanga nchumu, va dlayetela vavanuna hinkwavo.	On the third day, when they were sore, two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, took their swords and came against the city while it felt secure and killed all the males.
Hiloko va dlaya Hamoro ni n'wana wa yena Xikeme hi fumu, kutani va humesa Dina endlwini ya Xikeme va famba na yena.	They killed Hamor and his son Shechem with the sword and took Dinah out of Shechem's house and went away.
Kutani vana lavan'wana va Yakobo va ta eka lava dlayiweke, va fika va phangha swilo emutini, hikuva makwavo wa vona Dina a a nyamisiwile.	The sons of Jacob came upon the slain and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister.
Va teka swifuwo swa vona leswikulu ni leswitsongo, va teka ni timbhongolo ni swilo hinkwaswo leswi a swi ri emutini kumbe emasin'wini.	They took their flocks and their herds, their donkeys, and whatever was in the city and in the field.
Va teka ni rifumo ra vona hinkwaro, ni vana va vona ni vasati va vona, va teka ni swilo hinkwaswo leswi a swi ri etindlwini va famba na swona.	All their wealth, all their little ones and their wives, all that was in the houses, they captured and plundered.
Kutani Yakobo a ku ka Simiyoni na Levhi: Mi ndzi vangele khombo hi ku ndzi venganisa ni Vakanana ni Vaperesi, vona vaaki va tiko. Mina a ndzi na vavanuna vo tala, kutani loko vo twanana va hlangana va ta ndzi hlasela, va ta ndzi herisa, mina ni va ndyangu wa mina.	Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, You have brought trouble on me by making me stink to the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites and the Perizzites. My numbers are few, and if they gather themselves against me and attack me, I shall be destroyed, both I and my household.
Kambe vona va hlamula va ku: Hi nge pfumeli leswaku Xikeme a hundzula makwerhu a n'wi endla nghwavava.	But they said, Should he treat our sister like a prostitute?
Xikwembu xi ku ka Yakobo: Sweswi, suka u ya eBetele, u ya tshama kona. Kwale Betele, u ta aka alitari, u akela Xikwembu lexi humeleleke eka wena loko u ri karhi u baleka makwenu Esawu.	God said to Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel and dwell there. Make an altar there to the God who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau.
Hiloko Yakobo a byela va ndyangu wa yena ni hinkwavo lava a a ri na vona a ku: Cukumetani swikwembu swa vamatiko leswi nga xikarhi ka n'wina, mi tlhela mi tibasisa mi ambala swiambalo swin'wana	So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, Put away the foreign gods that are among you and purify yourselves and change your garments.
kutani hi ta suka hi famba hi ya eBetele leswaku ndzi ya aka alitari kona, ndzi akela Xikwembu lexi xi ndzi hlamuleke loko ndzi ri eku xanisekeni, xi tlhela xi va na mina hinkwako lomu ndzi yeke kona.	Then let us arise and go up to Bethel, so that I may make there an altar to the God who answers me in the day of my distress and has been with me wherever I have gone.
Kutani va nyika Yakobo swikwembu hinkwaswo swa vamatiko leswi a va ri na swona, va n'wi nyika ni swingwavila leswi a swi ri entindleveni ta vona. Hiloko Yakobo a ya swi celela ehansi ka murhi wa nkuhlu lowu a wu ri kwale kusuhi ni muti wa Xikeme.	So they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods that they had, and the rings that were in their ears. Jacob hid them under the terebinth tree that was near Shechem.
Kutani va khoma ndlela va famba, kutani Xikwembu xi endla leswaku vanhu va miti leyi a yi va rhendzerile matlhelo hinkwawo va khomiwa hi ku chava, va tsandzeka ku hlongorisa vana va Yakobo.	And as they journeyed, a terror from God fell upon the cities that were around them, so that they did not pursue the sons of Jacob.
Kutani Yakobo ni vanhu hinkwavo lava a a ri na vona va ya fika eLuzi (hileswaku Betele), etikweni ra Kanana.	And Jacob came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him
Laha Luzi, Yakobo a aka alitari a yi thya vito ra Eli-Betele (hileswaku: Xikwembu-xa-Betele), hikuva hi kona laha Xikwembu xi tikombiseke eka yena loko a ri karhi a baleka makwavo Esawu.	and there he built an altar and called the place El-bethel, because there God had revealed himself to him when he fled from his brother.
Debora mutirheli wa Rhaveka a lova, kutani va n'wi lahla ehansi ka murhi wa nkuhlu edzongeni ra muti wa Betele, hikokwalaho murhi lowu va wu thya vito ra Aloni-Bakuti (hileswaku: Nkuhlu-wa-swirilo).	And Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died, and she was buried under an oak below Bethel. So he called its name Allon-bacuth.
Loko Yakobo a ta a huma hi le Padani-Aramu, Xikwembu xi tlhela xi humelela eka yena, xi n'wi katekisa.	God appeared to Jacob again, when he came from Paddan-aram, and blessed him.
Xikwembu xi ku ka Yakobo: Vito ra wena hi wena Yakobo, kambe vito leri, a wu nga ha vitaniwi ha rona, u ta vitaniwa hi ra Israele. Kutani ko va loko Yakobo a thyiwile vito ra Israele.	And God said to him, Your name is Jacob; no longer shall your name be called Jacob, but Israel shall be your name. So he called his name Israel.
Kutani Xikwembu xi ku: Hi mina Xikwembu-xa-matimba-hinkwawo. Tswalanani mi andza, mi va tiko. Eka wena ku ta huma vanhu va matiko layo tala, hambi ti ri tihosi ti ta huma eka wena.	And God said to him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply. A nation and a company of nations shall come from you, and kings shall come from your own body.
Tiko leri ndzi ri nyikeke Abrahama na Isaka, ndzi ta ri nyika wena; tiko leri, ndzi ku nyika rona, wena ni vatukulu va wena lava nga ta sala va hanya endzhaku ka wena.	The land that I gave to Abraham and Isaac I will give to you, and I will give the land to your offspring after you.
Kutani Xikwembu xi tlhandluka xi suka laha a xi vulavula na Yakobo kona.	Then God went up from him in the place where he had spoken with him.
Hiloko Yakobo a yimisa ribye ra xitsundzuxo endhawini yoleyo, a tlhela a chela vhinyo ya magandzelo ehenhla ka ribye leri, a chela ni mafurha ehenhla ka rona.	And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he had spoken with him, a pillar of stone. He poured out a drink offering on it and poured oil on it.
Ndhawu leyi Yakobo a a ri ka yona loko Xikwembu xi vulavula na yena, a yi thya vito ra Betele (hileswaku: Yindlu-ya-Xikwembu).	So Jacob called the name of the place where God had spoken with him Bethel.
Kutani va suka eBetele va ya emahlweni ni riendzo. Loko va ha ri kulenyana ni muti wa Efrata, nkarhi wa Rahele wa ku tintshunxa wu fika, kutani switlhavi swa ku veleka swi n'wi tela hi matimba.	Then they journeyed from Bethel. When they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel went into labor, and she had hard labor.
Loko a ri karhi a tintshunxa, sungukati yi ku ka yena: Tiyisela, u kumile n'wana un'wana wa mufana.	And when her labor was at its hardest, the midwife said to her, Do not fear, for you have another son.
Rahele a a ri kusuhi ni ku fa, kutani loko a ri karhi a hlala, a thya n'wana loyi vito ra Benoni (hileswaku: N'wana-wa-ku-vaviseka-ka-mina), kambe tata wa yena a n'wi thya vito ra Benjamini (hileswaku: N'wana-wa-voko-ra-xinene).	And as her soul was departing (for she was dying), she called his name Ben-oni; but his father called him Benjamin.
Kutani Rahele a fa, a lahliwa endleleni yo ya le Efrata (hileswaku: Betlehema)	So Rachel died, and she was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem)
kutani Yakobo a yimisa ribye ra xitsundzuxo ehenhla ka sirha ra Rahele. Ribye leri, ninamuntlha ra ha ri kona, ri komba laha sirha ra Rahele ri nga kona.	and Jacob set up a pillar over her tomb. It is the pillar of Rachel's tomb, which is there to this day.
Yakobo a ya emahlweni ni riendzo ra yena, a ya fika a dzima ntsonga wa yena loko a hundzile xihondzo xa Edere.	Israel journeyed on and pitched his tent beyond the tower of Eder.
Vana va Leya hi lava: Rhuveni (yena mativula ya Yakobo), na Simiyoni, na Levhi, na Yuda, na Isakara, na Zebuloni.	The sons of Leah: Reuben (Jacob's firstborn), Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun.
Vana va Rahele hi lava: Yosefa na Benjamini.	The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.
Vana va Biliha nandza wa Rahele hi lava: Dani na Neftali.	The sons of Bilhah, Rachel's servant: Dan and Naphtali.
Vana va Zilipa nandza wa Leya hi lava: Gadi na Asere. Lava hi vona vana va Yakobo lava velekiweke ePadani-Aramu.	The sons of Zilpah, Leah's servant: Gad and Asher. These were the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Paddan-aram.
Kutani Yakobo a ya fika eka tata wa yena Isaka eMamre le Kiriyata-Araba (hileswaku: Hebroni), laha Abrahama na Isaka a va luverile kona.	And Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre, or Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had sojourned.
Enkarhini lowu, Isaka a a ri ni malembe ya 180	Now the days of Isaac were 180 years.
kutani Isaka a tietlelela a ri ni malembe yo tala swinene, a landza va ka vona. Kutani vana va yena Esawu na Yakobo va n'wi lahla.	And Isaac breathed his last, and he died and was gathered to his people, old and full of days. And his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
Leti i timhaka ta va ka Esawu (hileswaku: Edomu).	These are the generations of Esau (that is, Edom).
Esawu a a tekile vasati exikarhi ka Vaedomu: Ada n'wana Muhiti loyi a va ku i Elone, na Oholibama n'wana Muhori loyi a va ku i Ana n'wana Sibeyoni.	Esau took his wives from the Canaanites: Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, Oholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite
A teka na Basemati makwavo wa Nebayoto n'wana Iximaele.	and Basemath, Ishmael's daughter, the sister of Nebaioth.
Ada ú velekele Esawu n'wana loyi a va ku i Elifasi, kasi Basemati yena a veleka Rhuwele.	And Adah bore to Esau, Eliphaz; Basemath bore Reuel
Oholibama a veleka vana lava: Yewuxi, na Yalamu, na Kora. Lava hi vona vana va Esawu lava velekiweke etikweni ra Kanana.	and Oholibamah bore Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. These are the sons of Esau who were born to him in the land of Canaan.
Kutani Esawu a teka vasati va yena ni vana va yena va xinuna ni va xisati, ni vanhu hinkwavo lava a va tshama emutini wa yena, ni swifuwo swa yena leswikulu ni leswitsongo, a teka ni swilo hinkwaswo leswi a swi kumeke etikweni ra Kanana, kutani a suka a famba a hambana ni makwavo Yakobo, a ya tshama etikweni rin'wana.	Then Esau took his wives, his sons, his daughters, and all the members of his household, his livestock, all his beasts, and all his property that he had acquired in the land of Canaan. He went into a land away from his brother Jacob.
Esawu na Yakobo a va ri na swilo swo tala swinene, lero a va nga ta tshama endhawini yin'we, naswona eka tiko leri a va luvele eka rona a va nga ta kuma madyelo yo ringana ya swifuwo swa vona.	For their possessions were too great for them to dwell together. The land of their sojournings could not support them because of their livestock.
Hikokwalaho Esawu a ya a ya tshama emagangeni ya Seyira. Esawu loyi hi yena Edomu.	So Esau settled in the hill country of Seir. (Esau is Edom.)
Leti i timhaka ta va ka Esawu, yena tata wa Vaedomu lava tshamaka emagangeni ya Seyira.	These are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in the hill country of Seir.
Esawu a a ri ni n'wana loyi a va ku i Elifasi loyi a n'wi kumeke na nsati wa yena Ada, na n'wana loyi a va ku i Rhuwele loyi a n'wi kumeke na Basemati.	These are the names of Esau's sons: Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Basemath the wife of Esau.

Yakobo a a rhandza Yosefa ku tlula vamakwavo wa yena lavan'wana, hikuva a a n'wi kumile eku dyuhaleni ka yena. Hiloko a n'wi rhungela xiambalo lexo leha, xa mavoko yo leha.	Now Israel loved Joseph more than any other of his sons, because he was the son of his old age. And he made him a robe of many colors.
Kuteloko vamakwavo va vona leswaku tata wa vona ú rhandza Yosefa ku tlula vona hinkwavo, va sungula ku n'wi venga, va nga ha vulavuli na yena hi ndlela leyinene.	But when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him and could not speak peacefully to him.
Siku rin'wana, Yosefa a lorha norho; kuteloko a byela vamakwavo, vo ya va n'wi venga swinene.	Now Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers they hated him even more.
Yosefa a ku ka vona: Twanani norho lowu ndzi wu lorheke	He said to them, Hear this dream that I have dreamed
A hi ri karhi hi boha tinyandza emasin'wini, kutani nyandza ya mina yi suka yi yima, hiloko leta ka n'wina ti yi rhendzela, ti yi nkhinsamela.	Behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and behold, my sheaf arose and stood upright. And behold, your sheaves gathered around it and bowed down to my sheaf.
Vamakwavo va ku ka yena: Xana u vula leswaku hakunene u nga va hosi ya hina u hi fuma xana? Kutani va ya va n'wi venga swinene hikokwalaho ka milorho ya yena ni leswi a swi vulavulaka.	His brothers said to him, Are you indeed to reign over us? Or are you indeed to rule over us? So they hated him even more for his dreams and for his words.
Yosefa a lorha norho wun'wana, kutani a byela vamakwavo a ku: Ndzi lorhile norho wun'wana: Ndzi vona dyambu, ni n'weti, ni tinyeleti ta 11 swi ndzi nkhinsamela.	Then he dreamed another dream and told it to his brothers and said, Behold, I have dreamed another dream. Behold, the sun, the moon, and eleven stars were bowing down to me.
Kuteloko Yosefa a byela tata wa yena ni vamakwavo, tata wa yena a n'wi holovela a ku: Norho lowu u wu lorheke wu vula yini xana? Xana ku ta va na siku leri mina ni mana wa wena ni vamakwenu, hi nga ta ku nkhinsamela xana?	But when he told it to his father and to his brothers, his father rebuked him and said to him, What is this dream that you have dreamed? Shall I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow ourselves to the ground before you?
Hiloko vamakwavo va n'wi vondzoka, kambe tata wa yena a nga yi rivalanga mhaka leyi.	And his brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the saying in mind.
Siku rin'wana vamakwavo wa Yosefa va ya va ya risa swifuwo swa tata wa vona kusuhi ni muti wa Xikeme.	Now his brothers went to pasture their father's flock near Shechem.
Kutani Yakobo a ku ka Yosefa: Vamakwenu va le ku riseni ka swifuwo eXikeme, kutani wena tana ndzi ku rhuma eka vona. Yosefa a ku: Hi mina loyi!	And Israel said to Joseph, Are not your brothers pasturing the flock at Shechem? Come, I will send you to them. And he said to him, Here I am.
Yakobo a ku ka yena: Sweswi, famba u ya va pfuxela, u kamba ni swifuwo, kutani u vuya u ta ndzi rungulela mahungu ya kona. Kutani Yosefa a suka eka Nkova wa Hebroni, a ya fika eXikeme.	So he said to him, Go now, see if it is well with your brothers and with the flock, and bring me word. So he sent him from the Valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.
Kutani wanuna un'wana a kuma Yosefa a ri karhi a rhendzeleka enhoveni, a n'wi vutisa a ku: U lava yini xana?	And a man found him wandering in the fields. And the man asked him, What are you seeking?
Yosefa a ku: Ndzi lava vamakwerhu. Ndzi kombela leswaku u ndzi byela laha va riselaka kona swifuwo.	I am seeking my brothers, he said. Tell me, please, where they are pasturing the flock.
Kutani wanuna loyi a ku: Laha va sukile, ndzi twile va ku: ‘A hi yeni eDotani.’  Kutani Yosefa a famba a landza vamakwavo, a ya va kuma eDotani.	And the man said, They have gone away, for I heard them say, 'Let us go to Dothan.' So Joseph went after his brothers and found them at Dothan.
Kutani va n'wi vona a ha ta hi le kule. Loko a nga si fika laha a va ri kona, va endla makungu ya ku n'wi dlaya	They saw him from afar, and before he came near to them they conspired against him to kill him.
va byelana va ku: N'wamilorho hi loyi wa ta!	They said to one another, Here comes this dreamer.
A hi n'wi khomeni hi n'wi dlaya, hi n'wi hoxa eka rin'wana ra makhele lama nga kona, kutani hi ta ya vula leswaku ú dyiwile hi swiharhi swa nhova. Hi ta vona leswaku milorho ya yena wa ha ta yi lorhela kwihi!	Come now, let us kill him and throw him into one of the pits. Then we will say that a fierce animal has devoured him, and we will see what will become of his dreams.
Loko Rhuveni a twa mhaka leyi, a ringeta ku ponisa Yosefa emavokweni ya vona; a ku: Hi nga n'wi dlayi!	But when Reuben heard it, he rescued him out of their hands, saying, Let us not take his life.
Rhuveni a ya emahlweni a ku ka vona: Mi nga tshuki mi halata ngati; n'wi hoxeni ekheleni kwala mananga, kambe mi nga tshuki mi n'wi vavisa. Rhuveni a a endlela ku ponisa Yosefa, leswaku a ta n'wi tlherisela eka tata wa yena.	And Reuben said to them, Shed no blood; throw him into this pit here in the wilderness, but do not lay a hand on him—that he might rescue him out of their hand to restore him to his father.
Loko Yosefa a fika eka vamakwavo, va n'wi hluvula xiambalo lexo leha, xa mavoko yo leha, lexi a a xi ambarile	So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe, the robe of many colors that he wore.
kutani va n'wi khoma va n'wi hoxa ekheleni. Khele leri a ri nga ri na mati, a ma phyile.	And they took him and threw him into a pit. The pit was empty; there was no water in it.
Kutani va ya tshama ehansi va dya swakudya. Kuteloko va tlakusa mahlo, va vona ntlawa wa Vaiximaele lava a va huma eGiliyadi, va ri ni tikamela leti rhwaleke mirhi ya nkoka ni ya risuna ya tinxaka-xaka, va yi yisa etikweni ra Egipta.	Then they sat down to eat. And looking up they saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing gum, balm, and myrrh, on their way to carry it down to Egypt.
Hiloko Yuda a ku ka vamakwavo: Loko hi dlaya makwerhu kutani hi tumbeta mhaka ya kona, hi ta vuyeriwa hi yini xana?	Then Judah said to his brothers, What profit is it if we kill our brother and conceal his blood?
A hi n'wi xaviseleni Vaiximaele, hi nga tshuki hi n'wi vavisa, hikuva i makwerhu; hina na yena hi ngati yin'we. Kutani vamakwavo wa Yuda va pfumela.	Come, let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him, for he is our brother, our own flesh. And his brothers listened to him.
Vamidiyani lava fambaka va xava ni ku xavisa swilo, va hundza hi laha vamakwavo wa Yosefa a va ri kona, hiloko va humesa Yosefa ekheleni va n'wi xavisela Vaiximaele hi mali ya tisilivhere ta 20. Kutani Vaiximaele va ya na Yosefa le Egipta.	Then Midianite traders passed by. And they drew Joseph up and lifted him out of the pit, and sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty shekels of silver. They took Joseph to Egypt.
Kuteloko Rhuveni a ya ekheleni, o kuma leswaku Yosefa a nga kona, kutani a handzulela swiambalo swa yena	When Reuben returned to the pit and saw that Joseph was not in the pit, he tore his clothes
a ya eka vamakwavo a fika a ku: Mufana luya a nga kona, kutani sweswi mina ndzi ta ya kwihi xana?	and returned to his brothers and said, The boy is gone, and I, where shall I go?
Hiloko va dlaya mbuti, va teka xiambalo xa Yosefa va xi peta engatini	Then they took Joseph's robe and slaughtered a goat and dipped the robe in the blood.
kutani va teka xiambalo lexi xo leha xa mavoko yo leha, va xi yisa eka tata wa vona, va ku: Hi thumbhile xiambalo lexi; hi kombela leswaku u xi languta, u vona loko xi ri xiambalo xa n'wana wa wena kumbe xi nga ri xona.	And they sent the robe of many colors and brought it to their father and said, This we have found; please identify whether it is your son's robe or not.
Kutani Yakobo a xi languta, a ku: Lexi i xiambalo xa n'wananga. Swiharhi swa nhova swi n'wi dyile, Yosefa n'wananga ú phatluleriwile!	And he identified it and said, It is my son's robe. A fierce animal has devoured him. Joseph is without doubt torn to pieces.
Hiloko Yakobo a handzulela swiambalo swa yena, kutani a ambala leswo khwaxa, a rila n'wana wa yena masiku layo tala.	Then Jacob tore his garments and put sackcloth on his loins and mourned for his son many days.
Vana va yena hinkwavo va xinuna ni va xisati va ya va ya n'wi khongotela, kambe yena a ala ku khongoteriwa, a ku: E-e, ndzi ta kala ndzi fa ndzi landza n'wananga exivandleni xa vafi ndza ha rila. Kutani Yakobo a rila n'wana wa yena hi ndlela yoleyo.	All his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted and said, No, I shall go down to Sheol to my son, mourning. Thus his father wept for him.
Enkarhini lowu, Vamidiyani a va xavisile Yosefa eka Potifaro etikweni ra Egipta. Potifaro a a ri un'wana wa vatirheli va hosi Faro, naswona a a ri ndhuna ya varindzi.	Meanwhile the Midianites had sold him in Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the guard.
Enkarhini wolowo Yuda a suka laha a ku ri ni vamakwavo, a rhelela a ya tshama na Muadulama un'wana loyi a va ku i Hira.	It happened at that time that Judah went down from his brothers and turned aside to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.
Kuteloko Yuda a ri kwale, o vona nhwanyana un'wana, n'wana wa Mukanana loyi a va ku i Xuwa. Kutani Yuda a teka nhwanyana loyi, a va nsati wa yena	There Judah saw the daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua. He took her and went in to her
kutani a tika, a veleka n'wana wa mufana. Yuda a thya n'wana loyi evito ra Ere.	and she conceived and bore a son, and he called his name Er.
Kutani N'wa-Xuwa a tlhela a tika, a veleka n'wana wa mufana, a n'wi thya vito ra Onani.	She conceived again and bore a son, and she called his name Onan.
A tika kambe, a veleka n'wana wa mufana, a n'wi thya vito ra Xela. Loko n'wana loyi a velekiwa, Yuda a a ri eKezibi.	Yet again she bore a son, and she called his name Shelah. Judah was in Chezib when she bore him.
Kutani Yuda a tekela mativula ya yena Ere ensati; vito ra yena a a ri Tamara.	And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name was Tamar.
Kambe Ere, mativula ya Yuda, a a ri ni mahanyelo layo biha emahlweni ka HOSI Xikwembu; hikokwalaho HOSI Xikwembu xi n'wi susa emisaveni.	But Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD, and the LORD put him to death.
Kutani Yuda a ku ka Onani: Yana eka nsati wa makwenu, u hlayisana na yena, u kumela makwenu evana.	Then Judah said to Onan, Go in to your brother's wife and perform the duty of a brother-in-law to her, and raise up offspring for your brother.
Kambe Onani a a swi tiva leswaku vana va kona a va nga vi va yena; hikokwalaho, loko a ya tivana ni nsati wa makwavo, a a halatela ehansi, hi ku chava leswaku a nga ta n'wi kumisa vana lava nga ta ka va nga ri va yena.	But Onan knew that the offspring would not be his. So whenever he went in to his brother's wife he would waste the semen on the ground, so as not to give offspring to his brother.
Mhaka leyi Onani a a yi endla, HOSI Xikwembu a xi nga yi tsakeli, hiloko na yena xi n'wi susa emisaveni.	And what he did was wicked in the sight of the LORD, and he put him to death also.
Hikokwalaho, Yuda a ku ka Tamara: U to va noni u ri karikwenu, ku kondza Xela a kula. Yuda a a chava leswaku Xela na yena a nga fa ku fana ni vamakwavo. Hiloko Tamara a tlhelela ekarikwavo, a ya tshama kona.	Then Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law, Remain a widow in your father's house, till Shelah my son grows up—for he feared that he would die, like his brothers. So Tamar went and remained in her father's house.
Endzhaku ka malembenyana, N'wa-Xuwa nkata Yuda a lova. Loko Yuda a hetile ku rila nsati wa yena, a suka a famba ni nakulobye Hira lowa Muadulama, va ya laha vatsemeti va voya bya tinyimpfu ta yena a va ri kona, le Timina.	In the course of time the wife of Judah, Shua's daughter, died. When Judah was comforted, he went up to Timnah to his sheepshearers, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.
Kutani vanhu va ya byela Tamara, va ku: Tata wa nuna wa wena ú le ndleleni, ú tlhandlukela eTimina ku ya tsemeta voya bya tinyimpfu ta yena.	And when Tamar was told, Your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep,
Tamara a a swi tiva leswaku Xela ú kurile, kambe a va nga si va hlanganisa. Hiloko Tamara a hluvula swiambalo swa nkosi, a funengela nturhu, a tlhela a tiphutsela, a ya tshama enyangweni ya muti wa Enayini, endleleni yo ya eTimina.	she took off her widow's garments and covered herself with a veil, wrapping herself up, and sat at the entrance to Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah. For she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she had not been given to him in marriage.
Loko Yuda a n'wi vona, a ehleketa leswaku i nghwavava, hikuva a a tifunengetile xikandza.	When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face.
Hiloko Yuda a hambuka a ya laha a a ri kona, a fika a ku ka yena: Tana ndzi ya etlela na wena. Yuda a a nga swi tivi leswaku i n'wingi wa yena. Tamara a hlamula a ku: Xana u ta ndzi nyika yini, loko u etlela na mina, xana?	He turned to her at the roadside and said, Come, let me come in to you, for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. She said, What will you give me, that you may come in to me?
Yuda a hlamula a ku: Ndzi ta ya teka ximbutana entlhambini, ndzi ku rhumela xona. Tamara a ku: Xana u ta ndzi nyika yini lexi ndzi nga ta pfa ndzi xi khomile, ku kondza u rhumela ximbutana xa kona xana?	He answered, I will send you a young goat from the flock. And she said, If you give me a pledge, until you send it—
Yuda a ku: Xana ndzi nga ku khomisa yini xana? Tamara a hlamula a ku: Ndzi nyike mfungho wa wena ni ngoti ya kona, ni nhonga leyi u yi khomeke. Hiloko Yuda a n'wi nyika swona, a ya etlela na yena, kutani Tamara a tika.	He said, What pledge shall I give you? She replied, Your signet and your cord and your staff that is in your hand. So he gave them to her and went in to her, and she conceived by him.
Kutani Tamara a suka a famba, a fika a susa nturhu, a tlhela a ambala swiambalo leswa nkosi.	Then she arose and went away, and taking off her veil she put on the garments of her widowhood.
Kutani Yuda a rhuma nakulobye Hira lowa Muadulama ku yisa ximbutana eka lowa wansati, leswaku a ta vuya na swilo leswi a swi khomiseke lowa wansati, kambe Hira a nga n'wi kumanga.	When Judah sent the young goat by his friend the Adullamite to take back the pledge from the woman's hand, he did not find her.
Kutani Hira a vutisa vanhu va ndhawu yoleyo, a ku: Nghwavava leyi a yi ri etlhelo ka ndlela le Enayini, yi kwihi xana? Vona va hlamula va ku: Laha a ku vanga na nghwavava ni siku ni rin'we.	And he asked the men of the place, Where is the cult prostitute who was at Enaim at the roadside? And they said, No cult prostitute has been here.
Hiloko Hira a tlhelela eka Yuda, a fika a ku: Wansati luya a ndzi n'wi kumanga; hambi va ri vanhu va ndhawu yoleyo va te: ‘Laha a ku vanga na nghwavava ni siku ni rin'we!’ 	So he returned to Judah and said, I have not found her. Also, the men of the place said, 'No cult prostitute has been here.'
Kutani Yuda a ku: Swilo leswiya, a a tihlayisele swona swi va swa yena, hikuva hi nga kala hi hundzuka swihlekiso. Na wena u swi vonile, ndzi ringetile ku rhumela ximbutana, kambe a wu n'wi kumanga wansati loyi.	And Judah replied, Let her keep the things as her own, or we shall be laughed at. You see, I sent this young goat, and you did not find her.
Endzhaku ka tin'hweti tinharhu, Yuda a kuma rito leri nge: N'wingi wa wena Tamara ú endlile vunghwavava, kutani sweswi ú tikile. Kutani Yuda a ku: N'wi vuyiseni haleno, a ta hisiwa!	About three months later Judah was told, Tamar your daughter-in-law has been immoral. Moreover, she is pregnant by immorality. And Judah said, Bring her out, and let her be burned.
Loko a ri karhi a vuyisiwa, Tamara a rhumela rito eka tata wa nuna wa yena, a ku: Khwiri leri ndzi nga na rona i ra n'wini wa swilo leswi! Tamara a ya emahlweni a ku: Ndzi kombela leswaku u languta mfungho lowu ni ngoti ya kona ni nhonga leyi, u vona leswaku i swa mani!	As she was being brought out, she sent word to her father-in-law, By the man to whom these belong, I am pregnant. And she said, Please identify whose these are, the signet and the cord and the staff.
Hiloko Yuda a swi vona leswaku swilo leswi i swa yena, kutani a ku: Wansati loyi, wa ndzi tlula hi ku lulama. Mina ndzi tsandzekile ku n'wi nyiketa eka Xela n'wananga. Yuda a nga ha tlhelanga a etlela na yena ni siku ni rin'we.	Then Judah identified them and said, She is more righteous than I, since I did not give her to my son Shelah. And he did not know her again.
Loko nkarhi wa Tamara wa ku tintshunxa wu ri kusuhi, ku kumeka leswaku ú ta veleka mahahlwa.	When the time of her labor came, there were twins in her womb.
Loko a ri karhi a tintshunxa, un'wana n'wana a humesa voko, kutani sungukati yi teka ngoti yo tshwuka yi boha evokweni ra n'wana loyi, yi ku: Loyi hi yena a rhangeke a huma.	And when she was in labor, one put out a hand, and the midwife took and tied a scarlet thread on his hand, saying, This one came out first.
Kambe loko n'wana loyi a tlherisa voko, makwavo a huma, kutani sungukati yi ku: Wa swi kota ku phohla ke! Hikokwalaho a thyiwa vito ra Perese (hileswaku: Ku phohla).	But as he drew back his hand, behold, his brother came out. And she said, What a breach you have made for yourself! Therefore his name was called Perez.
Eku heteleleni, ku ta ku ta huma makwavo wa Perese, a ri ni ngoti yo tshwuka evokweni, kutani yena a thyiwa vito ra Zera (hileswaku: Ku tshwuka).	Afterward his brother came out with the scarlet thread on his hand, and his name was called Zerah.
Enkarhini lowu, Vaiximaele a va yisile Yosefa etikweni ra Egipta. Muegipta loyi a va ku i Potifaro, un'wana wa vatirheli va hosi Faro, tlhelo ndhuna ya varindzi, a a xavile Yosefa eka Vaiximaele lava.	Now Joseph had been brought down to Egypt, and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, had bought him from the Ishmaelites who had brought him down there.
HOSI Xikwembu a xi ri na Yosefa, kutani a a kateka eka hinkwaswo leswi a swi endlaka. Yosefa a a tshama emutini wa n'wini wa yena lowa Muegipta.	The LORD was with Joseph, and he became a successful man, and he was in the house of his Egyptian master.
Kutani n'wini loyi wa yena a vona leswaku HOSI Xikwembu xi na Yosefa, ni leswaku hinkwaswo leswi a swi vekeke emavokweni ya Yosefa, HOSI Xikwembu xa swi katekisa.	His master saw that the LORD was with him and that the LORD caused all that he did to succeed in his hands.
Kutani Yosefa a tsakeriwa hi n'wini wa yena; a endliwa mutirheli wa yena, a vekiwa ku va mulanguteri wa muti wa yena ni muhlayisi wa swilo swa yena hinkwaswo.	So Joseph found favor in his sight and attended him, and he made him overseer of his house and put him in charge of all that he had.
Ku sukela nkarhi lowu Yosefa a vekiweke ku va mulanguteri wa muti wa Muegipta ni muhlayisi wa swilo swa yena hinkwaswo, HOSI Xikwembu xi katekisile muti wa Muegipta hikwalaho ka yena, xi katekisa swilo hinkwaswo swa Muegipta, swa le mutini ni swa le masin'wini.	From the time that he made him overseer in his house and over all that he had, the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; the blessing of the LORD was on all that he had, in house and field.
Endzhaku ka masikunyana, nkata Potifaro a navela Yosefa, kutani a ku ka yena: Tana hi ta etlela swin'we.	And after a time his master's wife cast her eyes on Joseph and said, Lie with me.
Kambe Yosefa a ala, kutani a ku ka nsati wa n'wini wa yena: Vona, leswi ku nga na mina kwala, n'wini wanga a nga ha tikarhateli nchumu xa laha mutini wa yena; swilo swa yena hinkwaswo ú swi vekile emavokweni ya mina.	But he refused and said to his master's wife, Behold, because of me my master has no concern about anything in the house, and he has put everything that he has in my charge.
Laha mutini wa yena, mina na yena ha ringana hi matimba. Ku hava lexi a ndzi alelaka xona handle ka wena ntsena, hikuva u nsati wa yena. Mhaka yo bihisa leswi, ndzi nga ka ndzi nga yi endli, hikuva ndzi ta va ndzi dyohela Xikwembu.	He is not greater in this house than I am, nor has he kept back anything from me except you, because you are his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness and sin against God?
Nkata Potifaro a a hamba a vulavula na Yosefa hi ndlela leyi siku rin'wana ni rin'wana, kambe Yosefa a nga pfumelanga ku etlela na yena, hambi ku ri ku tshama na yena.	And as she spoke to Joseph day after day, he would not listen to her, to lie beside her or to be with her.
Siku rin'wana, Yosefa a nghena endlwini ku ya tirha mintirho ya yena, kutani a kuma vatirhi lavan'wana va nga ri kona.	But one day, when he went into the house to do his work and none of the men of the house was there in the house
Hiloko nkata Potifaro a khoma Yosefa hi xiambalo, a ku ka yena: Tana hi ta etlela swin'we. Kambe Yosefa a chupula a tsutsuma a huma endlwini, a n'wi siya ni xiambalo.	she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me. But he left his garment in her hand and fled and got out of the house.
Kuteloko nkata Potifaro a vona leswaku Yosefa ú sukile a tsutsuma a n'wi siya ni xiambalo	And as soon as she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled out of the house
o vitana malandza ya laha mutini wa yena, a ku ka wona: Vonani, Potifaro u hi tisele Muheveru a ta hi rhuketela. Muheveru loyi ú tile eka mina a lava ku etlela na mina, kambe mina ndzi kalakarile ndzi ba huwa	she called to the men of her household and said to them, See, he has brought among us a Hebrew to laugh at us. He came in to me to lie with me, and I cried out with a loud voice.
kuteloko a twa leswaku ndzi le ku kalakaleni o suka a tsutsuma, a ndzi siya ni xiambalo xa yena.	And as soon as he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried out, he left his garment beside me and fled and got out of the house.
Kutani nkata Potifaro a hlayisa xiambalo lexi ku kondza nuna wa yena a vuya.	Then she laid up his garment by her until his master came home
Loko Potifaro a vuya, nsati a n'wi rungulela mhaka leyi, a ku: Nandza loyi wa Muheveru loyi u hi tiseleke yena, ú tile eka mina a ta ndzi rhuketela	and she told him the same story, saying, The Hebrew servant, whom you have brought among us, came in to me to laugh at me.
kambe loko a twa leswaku ndzi ba nkalanga, o suka a tsutsuma a ndzi siya ni xiambalo xa yena.	But as soon as I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his garment beside me and fled out of the house.
Kuteloko Potifaro n'wini wa Yosefa a twa leswi nsati wa yena a swi vulaka hi tlhelo ra yena Yosefa, a hlundzuka swinene.	As soon as his master heard the words that his wife spoke to him, This is the way your servant treated me, his anger was kindled.
Kutani a teka Yosefa a n'wi nghenisa ekhotsweni, laha ku pfaleriwaka vabohiwa va hosi Faro, a tshama kona.	And Joseph's master took him and put him into the prison, the place where the king's prisoners were confined, and he was there in prison.
Kambe HOSI Xikwembu xi va na Yosefa, xi n'wi komba tintswalo leto tshembeka, xi endla leswaku mulanguteri wa khotso a n'wi tsakela.	But the LORD was with Joseph and showed him steadfast love and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison.
Kutani mulanguteri wa khotso a veka Yosefa ku va ndhuna ya vabohiwa hinkwavo lava nga khotsweni. Xin'wana ni xin'wana lexi a xi endliwa ekhotsweni a xi tiva hi Yosefa.	And the keeper of the prison put Joseph in charge of all the prisoners who were in the prison. Whatever was done there, he was the one who did it.
Mulanguteri wa khotso a a nga ha tikarhateli nchumu eka leswi a swi ri emavokweni ya Yosefa, hikuva HOSI Xikwembu a xi ri na Yosefa, kutani a a kateka emintirhweni ya yena hinkwayo.	The keeper of the prison paid no attention to anything that was in Joseph's charge, because the LORD was with him. And whatever he did, the LORD made it succeed.
Kuteloko ku hundzile masikunyana, mucheri wa vhinyo ya hosi ya Egipta swin'we ni muphameri wa xinkwa xa yona, va dyohela n'wini loyi wa vona.	Some time after this, the cupbearer of the king of Egypt and his baker committed an offense against their lord the king of Egypt.
Kutani hosi Faro a hlundzukela vatirhi lavambirhi, ku nga ndhuna ya vacheri va vhinyo ni ndhuna ya vaphameri va xinkwa.	And Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker
Hiloko hosi Faro a va nyiketa eka ndhuna ya varindzi, leswaku a va rindza emutini wa yena, laha a ku ri ni khotso leri Yosefa a a pfaleriwile eka rona.	and he put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, in the prison where Joseph was confined.
Kutani ndhuna ya varindzi yi lerisa Yosefa ku va tirhela, a va nandza wa vona. Kutani va tshamile masikunyana va ri karhi va rindziwa.	The captain of the guard appointed Joseph to be with them, and he attended them. They continued for some time in custody.
Kutani siku rin'wana nivusiku, mucheri wa vhinyo ya hosi ya Egipta, ni muphameri wa xinkwa xa yona, va lorha milorho havumbirhi bya vona, va ri kwale khotsweni; norho wun'wana ni wun'wana a wu ri ni nhlamuselo ya wona.	And one night they both dreamed—the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison—each his own dream, and each dream with its own interpretation.
Kuteloko Yosefa a ta eka vona nimpundzu, a swi vona leswaku a va tsakanga emoyeni.	When Joseph came to them in the morning, he saw that they were troubled.
Kutani Yosefa a vutisa malandza lawa ya hosi Faro, lawa a ma rindziwa kwala mutini wa n'wini wa yena, a ku: Hikwalaho ka yini tinghohe ta n'wina ti nga tsakanga, xana?	So he asked Pharaoh's officers who were with him in custody in his master's house, Why are your faces downcast today?
Vona va ku ka yena: Hi lorhile milorho, kutani a ku na munhu loyi a nga yi hlamuselaka. Kutani Yosefa a ku ka vona: Xana a hi Xikwembu lexi hlamuselaka milorho xana? Ndzi kombela leswaku mi ndzi byela milorho ya kona.	They said to him, We have had dreams, and there is no one to interpret them. And Joseph said to them, Do not interpretations belong to God? Please tell them to me.
Hiloko ndhuna ya vacheri va vhinyo yi byela Yosefa norho wa yona, yi ku: Enorhweni wa mina, ndzi vonile murhi wa vhinya	So the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph and said to him, In my dream there was a vine before me
emurhini lowu wa vhinya, a ku ri ni marhavi manharhu. Wu lo na hluka, wo baleka swiluva, wu tswala swichocho swa mihandzu leyi vupfeke.	and on the vine there were three branches. As soon as it budded, its blossoms shot forth, and the clusters ripened into grapes.
Evokweni a ndzi khomile xinwelo xa hosi Faro, kutani ndzi teka mihandzu ya vhinya ndzi kamela exinwelweni lexi, ndzi nyika hosi Faro.	Pharaoh's cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup and placed the cup in Pharaoh's hand.
Hiloko Yosefa a ku ka yena: Nhlamuselo ya norho wa wena hi leyi: Marhavi lawa manharhu ma vula masiku manharhu.	Then Joseph said to him, This is its interpretation: the three branches are three days.
Loko ku nga si hundza masiku manharhu, hosi Faro ú ta ku humesa ekhotsweni, a ku tlherisela entirhweni wa wena, kutani u ta hamba u nyika hosi Faro xinwelo xa yena, ku fana ni khale loko wa ha ri mucheri wa vhinyo ya yena.	In three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your office, and you shall place Pharaoh's cup in his hand as formerly, when you were his cupbearer.
Kambe ndzi kombela leswaku u nga ndzi rivali loko se swi ku fambela kahle. U fanele ku ndzi pfuna, u ndzi vulavulela na hosi Faro, leswaku na mina ndzi ta huma laha khotsweni.	Only remember me, when it is well with you, and please do me the kindness to mention me to Pharaoh, and so get me out of this house.
Etikweni ra Vaheveru, a ndzi sukanga hi ku swi lava, kambe ndzi lo yiviwa kunene; kasi na kona kwala, ndzi lo pfaleleriwa xilo lexi ndzi nga xi endlangiki.	For I was indeed stolen out of the land of the Hebrews, and here also I have done nothing that they should put me into the pit.
Loko ndhuna ya vaphameri va xinkwa yi vona leswaku nhlamuselo ya kona hi leyinene, yi ku ka Yosefa: Na mina ndzi lorhile: A ndzi rhwele swirhundzu swinharhu swa swimbhundzwa enhlokweni.	When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was favorable, he said to Joseph, I also had a dream: there were three cake baskets on my head
Exirhundzwini lexi a xi ri ehenhla, a ku ri ni swimbhundzwa swa tinxaka-xaka leswi a swi swekeriwe hosi Faro, kambe tinyanyana a ti ri karhi ti swi dya ndza ha swi rhwele.	and in the uppermost basket there were all sorts of baked food for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating it out of the basket on my head.
Hiloko Yosefa a ku: Nhlamuselo ya kona hi leyi: Swirhundzu leswinharhu swi vula masiku manharhu.	And Joseph answered and said, This is its interpretation: the three baskets are three days.
Loko ku nga si hundza masiku manharhu, hosi Faro ú ta ku humesa ekhotsweni, a ya ku tsema nhloko, a ku hayeka emurhini, kutani tinyanyana ti ta dya nyama ya wena.	In three days Pharaoh will lift up your head—from you!—and hang you on a tree. And the birds will eat the flesh from you.
Hi siku ra vunharhu, ri nga siku leri hosi Faro a a tsundzuka ku velekiwa ka yena, a endlela malandza ya yena hinkwawo enkhuvo lowukulu. Kutani a humesa ndhuna ya vacheri va vhinyo ni ndhuna ya vaphameri va xinkwa ekhotsweni, a va tisa emahlweni ka malandza laman'wana.	On the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, he made a feast for all his servants and lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker among his servants.
Kutani hosi Faro a tlherisela ndhuna ya vacheri entirhweni wa yona wo chela vhinyo, leswaku yi hamba yi n'wi nyika xinwelo.	He restored the chief cupbearer to his position, and he placed the cup in Pharaoh's hand.
Kambe ndhuna ya vaphameri yona yi hayekiwa emurhini, hilaha Yosefa a va hlamuseleke hakona.	But he hanged the chief baker, as Joseph had interpreted to them.
Hambiswiritano, ndhuna ya vacheri a yi n'wi tsundzukanga Yosefa, yi n'wi rivarile.	Yet the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph, but forgot him.
Endzhaku ka malembe mambirhi, hosi Faro a lorha a yimile eribuweni ra nambu wa Nilo.	After two whole years, Pharaoh dreamed that he was standing by the Nile
Enorhweni wa yena a vona tihomu ta mantswele ta 7, leto nona, ta xiyimo xo saseka; a ti ri karhi ti huma enambyeni wa Nilo, ti ya dya enhlangeni.	and behold, there came up out of the Nile seven cows, attractive and plump, and they fed in the reed grass.
Kutani ku tlhela ku humelela tihomu tin'wana ta mantswele ta 7 leto ondza, ta xiyimo xo biha, na tona ti huma enambyeni ti landza tihomu leto sungula, ti ya yima kusuhi na tona eribuweni ra nambu.	And behold, seven other cows, ugly and thin, came up out of the Nile after them, and stood by the other cows on the bank of the Nile.
Kutani tihomu ta mantswele leto ondza ta xiyimo xo biha, ti dya tihomu leto nona ta 7 ta xiyimo xo saseka. Kutani hosi Faro a phaphama.	And the ugly, thin cows ate up the seven attractive, plump cows. And Pharaoh awoke.
Hosi Faro a tlhela a khomiwa hi vurhongo, kutani a lorha nakambe, a vona min'woko ya 7 ya koroni, yo saseka leyi vekeke swinene yi mila yi huma erihlangeni rin'we.	And he fell asleep and dreamed a second time. And behold, seven ears of grain, plump and good, were growing on one stalk.
Endzhaku ka yona, ku mila min'woko ya 7 ya koroni, leyi nga chelangiki, leyi vunisiweke hi moya wa le vuxeni	And behold, after them sprouted seven ears, thin and blighted by the east wind.
kutani yi mita min'woko leya 7 leyi vekeke tindzhoho to tala swinene. Kavaloko hosi Faro a phaphama, kutani a vona leswaku o va eku lorheni.	And the thin ears swallowed up the seven plump, full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and behold, it was a dream.
Nimixo hosi Faro a a karhateka emoyeni, kutani a rhuma vanhu va ya vitana vangoma hinkwavo va tiko ra Egipta ni tintlhari ta rona hinkwato. Loko Faro a va rungulerile norho wa yena, a ku vanga na un'we exikarhi ka vona loyi a koteke ku n'wi byela nhlamuselo ya kona.	So in the morning his spirit was troubled, and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt and all its wise men. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but there was none who could interpret them to Pharaoh.
Hiloko ndhuna ya vacheri va vhinyo ya hosi Faro yi ku ka yena: Namuntlha ndzi tsundzuka xihoxo lexi ndzi xi endleke!	Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, I remember my offenses today.
Siku rin'wana wena hosi Faro a wu hi hlundzukerile hina malandza ya wena, mina ni ndhuna ya vaphameri va xinkwa, u lerisa leswaku hi ya tshama emutini wa ndhuna ya varindzi.	When Pharaoh was angry with his servants and put me and the chief baker in custody in the house of the captain of the guard
Kutani hi vumbirhi bya hina, hi lorha milorho vusiku byin'we, norho wun'wana ni wun'wana wu ri ni nhlamuselo ya wona.	we dreamed on the same night, he and I, each having a dream with its own interpretation.
A hi ri na jaha rin'wana ra Muheveru kwale, leri a ri ri nandza wa ndhuna ya varindzi. Kuteloko hi ri byerile milorho ya hina, rona ri hi hlamuserile yona, ri byela un'wana ni un'wana wa hina nhlamuselo ya norho wa yena.	A young Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard. When we told him, he interpreted our dreams to us, giving an interpretation to each man according to his dream.
Leswi ri hi hlamuseleke swona, swi humelerile hilaha ri vuleke hakona. Mina ndzi tlhelerile entirhweni wa mina, kambe muphameri wa xinkwa yena ú hayekiwile.	And as he interpreted to us, so it came about. I was restored to my office, and the baker was hanged.
Kutani Faro a rhuma vanhu va ya vitana Yosefa ekhotsweni, va vuya na yena hi ku hatlisa. Kuteloko Yosefa a hetile ku byewula nhloko ni loko a ambarile swiambalo swin'wana, a ya emahlweni ka Faro.	Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they quickly brought him out of the pit. And when he had shaved himself and changed his clothes, he came in before Pharaoh.
Kutani Faro a ku ka Yosefa: Ndzi lorhile norho, kutani a ku na munhu loyi a kotaka ku ndzi hlamusela wona; ndzi twile leswaku wena wa swi kota ku hlamusela norho loko u byeriwe wona.	And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I have had a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it. I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.
Yosefa a ku ka Faro: We hosi Faro, a hi mina ndzi nga ta ku nyika nhlamuselo yo twala, kambe i Xikwembu.	Joseph answered Pharaoh, It is not in me; God will give Pharaoh a favorable answer.
Kutani Faro a ku ka Yosefa: Ndzi lorhile ndzi yimile eribuweni ra nambu wa Nilo	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, Behold, in my dream I was standing on the banks of the Nile.
ndzi vona tihomu ta mantswele ta 7 to nona ta xiyimo xo saseka ti ri karhi ti huma enambyeni wa Nilo, ti ya dya enhlangeni	Seven cows, plump and attractive, came up out of the Nile and fed in the reed grass.
kutani ku humelela tihomu tin'wana ta mantswele ta 7 leti tsaneke, to ondza ngopfu ta xiyimo xo biha, ti landza leto sungula; tihomu to tano a ndzi si tshama ndzi ti vona tikweni hinkwaro ra Egipta.	Seven other cows came up after them, poor and very ugly and thin, such as I had never seen in all the land of Egypt.
Kutani tihomu ta mantswele to ondza ta xiyimo xo biha ti dya tihomu leto sungula ta mantswele to nona ta 7.	And the thin, ugly cows ate up the first seven plump cows
Kambe endzhaku ka loko ti dyile letin'wana, a swi nga vonaki na kutsongo leswaku ti dyile xanchumu, hikuva tihomu ta kona a ta ha ondzile ku fana ni khale. Kutani ndzi phaphama.	but when they had eaten them no one would have known that they had eaten them, for they were still as ugly as at the beginning. Then I awoke.
Kutani ndzi lorha nakambe, ndzi vona min'woko ya 7 ya koroni yi ri karhi yi mila yi huma erihlangeni rin'we, yi vekile tindzhoho to tala swinene.	I also saw in my dream seven ears growing on one stalk, full and good.
Kutani ku huma min'woko yin'wana ya 7 leyi nga chelangiki, leyi vunisiweke hi moya wa le vuxeni.	Seven ears, withered, thin, and blighted by the east wind, sprouted after them
Hiloko min'woko leya 7 leyi nga chelangiki yi mita leya 7 leyi vekeke swinene. Vangoma ndzi va tivisile milorho leyi, kambe a ku na loyi a koteke ku ndzi nyika nhlamuselo ya kona.	and the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears. And I told it to the magicians, but there was no one who could explain it to me.
Kutani Yosefa a ku ka Faro: We hosi Faro, norho wa wena i wun'we: Xikwembu xi ku komba leswi xi lavaka ku swi endla.	Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, The dreams of Pharaoh are one; God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do.
Tihomu ta mantswele ta 7 leto saseka i malembe ya 7, ni min'woko ya 7 leyo saseka i malembe ya 7; milorho leyi yi vula xilo xin'we.	The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years; the dreams are one.
Tihomu ta mantswele ta 7 leto ondza ta xiyimo xo biha, leti humeleleke endzhaku ka leta 7 to nona, ni min'woko ya 7 leyi nga chelangiki leyi vunisiweke hi moya wa le vuxeni, i malembe ya 7 ya ndlala.	The seven lean and ugly cows that came up after them are seven years, and the seven empty ears blighted by the east wind are also seven years of famine.
Tani hilaha ndzi ku byeleke hakona we hosi Faro, Xikwembu xi ku kombile leswi xi lavaka ku swi endla.	It is as I told Pharaoh; God has shown to Pharaoh what he is about to do.
Etikweni hinkwaro ra Egipta, ku ta va ni malembe ya 7 ya ndzalo swinene.	There will come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt
Endzhaku ka malembe lawa ya ndzalo, ku ta va ni malembe ya 7 ya dyandza. Vanhu va Egipta va ta rivala ni leswaku a ku ri ni ndzalo etikweni, hikuva tiko hinkwaro ri ta fa hi ndlala.	but after them there will arise seven years of famine, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt. The famine will consume the land
Malembe ya ndzalo ma ta rivariwa etikweni, hikokwalaho ka dyandza leri ri nga ta va kona, hikuva ri ta chavisa ngopfu.	and the plenty will be unknown in the land by reason of the famine that will follow, for it will be very severe.
Leswi u lorheke mhaka leyi kambirhi we hosi Faro, swi komba leswaku yi lulamisiwile hi Xikwembu, naswona xi ta endla leswaku yi hatla yi humelela.	And the doubling of Pharaoh's dream means that the thing is fixed by God, and God will shortly bring it about.
Kutani we hosi Faro, hlawula wanuna loyi a twisisaka, wo tlhariha, u n'wi veka ku va murhangeri wa tiko ra Egipta.	Now therefore let Pharaoh select a discerning and wise man, and set him over the land of Egypt.
Naswona hlawula vanhu u va veka ku va valanguteri etikweni va ta hamba va teka xiphemu xa ⅕ xa leswi Vaegipta va nga ta tshovela swona emalembeni lawa ya 7 ya ndzalo.	Let Pharaoh proceed to appoint overseers over the land and take one-fifth of the produce of the land of Egypt during the seven plentiful years.
Va byele va hlengeleta swakudya leswi hinkwaswo emalembeni ya ndzalo lama taka. U va nyika matimba yo chela koroni eswitlatini, emutini wun'wana ni wun'wana, kutani va yi hlayisa.	And let them gather all the food of these good years that are coming and store up grain under the authority of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it.
Swakudya sweswo swi ta hlayiseriwa malembe ya 7 ya dyandza leri nga ta wela tiko ra Egipta; hikokwalaho tiko a ri nga fi hi ndlala.	That food shall be a reserve for the land against the seven years of famine that are to occur in the land of Egypt, so that the land may not perish through the famine.
Hosi Faro ni malandza ya yena hinkwawo, va nkhensa mhaka leyi	This proposal pleased Pharaoh and all his servants.
kutani Faro a ku ka malandza ya yena: Munhu wo fambisiwa hi Moya wa Xikwembu ku fana ni loyi, hi nga n'wi kuma kwihi xana?	And Pharaoh said to his servants, Can we find a man like this, in whom is the Spirit of God?
Kutani Faro a ku ka Yosefa: Xikwembu hi xona xi ku tiviseke timhaka leti hinkwato, hikokwalaho a ku na munhu wo twisisa ni ku tlhariha ku fana na wena.	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, Since God has shown you all this, there is none so discerning and wise as you are.
U ta va mulanguteri wa muti wa mina, kutani vanhu hinkwavo va tiko ra mina va ta yingisa swileriso swa wena; mina ndzi ta ku tlula ntsena hi ku va exiluvelweni xa vuhosi.	You shall be over my house, and all my people shall order themselves as you command. Only as regards the throne will I be greater than you.
Hosi Faro a engeta a ku ka Yosefa: Vona, ndzi ku veka ku va mulanguteri wa tiko hinkwaro ra Egipta!	And Pharaoh said to Joseph, See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.
Hiloko Faro a susa xingwavila xa yena xo fungha ha xona, a xi tlhoma eritihweni ra Yosefa, a n'wi ambexa swiambalo swa ntsembyani wo saseka, a n'wi ambexa ni nketani ya nsuku enhan'wini.	Then Pharaoh took his signet ring from his hand and put it on Joseph's hand, and clothed him in garments of fine linen and put a gold chain about his neck.
Kutani a n'wi khandziyisa ekalichini leyi landzaka ya yena hi ku saseka; vanhu a va huwelela emahlweni ka Yosefa, va ku: Nkhinsamani ehansi! Hi ndlela leyi, Faro a veka Yosefa ku va murhangeri wa tiko hinkwaro ra Egipta.	And he made him ride in his second chariot. And they called out before him, Bow the knee! Thus he set him over all the land of Egypt.
Faro a engeta a ku ka Yosefa: Hosi Faro hi mina, kutani ndzi ri: Etikweni hinkwaro ra Egipta, a ku nga vi na munhu la nga ta endla xanchumu, loko wena u nga n'wi pfumelelanga.	Moreover, Pharaoh said to Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without your consent no one shall lift up hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.
Kutani hosi Faro a thya Yosefa evito ra Safanati-Paneyaka, a n'wi nyika ni nsati, a nga Asnati N'wa-Potifera muprista wa muti wa Ono. Kutani Yosefa a huma a famba a kambela tiko ra Egipta.	And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphenath-paneah. And he gave him in marriage Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On. So Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.
Loko Yosefa a sungula ku tirhela Faro hosi ya Egipta, a a ri ni malembe ya 30. Kutani a suka emutini wa hosi Faro a rhendzeleka ni tiko hinkwaro ra Egipta.	Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh and went through all the land of Egypt.
Emalembeni ya 7 ya ndzalo, vanhu va tshovela swakudya leswo tala.	During the seven plentiful years the earth produced abundantly
Kutani Yosefa a hlengeleta swakudya hinkwaswo leswi kumekeke etikweni ra Egipta, emalembeni walawo ya 7, a swi hlayisa emitini. Emutini wun'wana ni wun'wana, Yosefa a a byela vanhu va kona ku chela eswitlatini leswi va swi tshoveleke emasin'wini ya vona.	and he gathered up all the food of these seven years, which occurred in the land of Egypt, and put the food in the cities. He put in every city the food from the fields around it.
Koroni leyi Yosefa a yi hlengeleteke a yi tele ku fana ni sava ra lwandle, a kondza a tshika ni ku yi pima, hikuva a yi nga ha pimeki.	And Joseph stored up grain in great abundance, like the sand of the sea, until he ceased to measure it, for it could not be measured.
Loko malembe ya dyandza ma nga si fika, Asnati, n'wana Potifera muprista wa muti wa Ono, ú velekerile Yosefa evana vambirhi va vafana.	Before the year of famine came, two sons were born to Joseph. Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bore them to him.
Kutani Yosefa a thya n'wana lowa mativula evito ra Manase, hikuva a a ku: Xikwembu xi endlile leswaku ndzi rivala maxangu ya mina hinkwawo, ndzi nga ha tsundzuki ni le kaya.	Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh. For, he said, God has made me forget all my hardship and all my father's house.
Kutani Yosefa a thya n'wana wa yena wa vumbirhi evito ra Efrayimi, hikuva a a ku: Xikwembu xi ndzi nyikile vana etikweni leri ndzi xanisekeke eka rona.	The name of the second he called Ephraim, For God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.
Malembe ya 7 ya ndzalo ma hela etikweni ra Egipta	The seven years of plenty that occurred in the land of Egypt came to an end
kutani ku sungula malembe ya 7 ya dyandza, hilaha Yosefa a vuleke hakona. Matiko hinkwawo ma wela hi ndlala. Tiko hinkwaro ra Egipta rona a ra ha sele ni swakudya	and the seven years of famine began to come, as Joseph had said. There was famine in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.
kambe loko ri sungula ku wela hi ndlala na rona, Vaegipta va ya rila eka Faro, va kombela swakudya, yena a va hlamula hinkwavo a ku: Yanani eka Yosefa, mi endla leswi a nga ta mi byela swona.	When all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread. Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, Go to Joseph. What he says to you, do.
Loko dyandza ri funengetile tiko hinkwaro, Yosefa a lerisa leswaku switlati hinkwaswo swi pfuriwa, kutani a sungula ku xavisela Vaegipta koroni, hikuva ndlala ya kona a yi chavisa swinene etikweni.	So when the famine had spread over all the land, Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe in the land of Egypt.
Hambi va ri vanhu va matiko hinkwawo a va ta eka Yosefa etikweni ra Egipta va ta xava koroni, hikuva ndlala a yi chavisa ematikweni hinkwawo.	Moreover, all the earth came to Egypt to Joseph to buy grain, because the famine was severe over all the earth.
Kuteloko Yakobo a twa leswaku koroni yi kona le Egipta, a ku ka vana va yena: Mi tshamela yini mi langutana hi mahlo xana?	When Jacob learned that there was grain for sale in Egypt, he said to his sons, Why do you look at one another?
A engeta a ku: Yingisani, ndzi twe leswaku koroni yi kona le Egipta; kutani n'wina rhelelani mi ya hi xavela, hi ta ka hi nga fi hi ndlala.	And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is grain for sale in Egypt. Go down and buy grain for us there, that we may live and not die.
Hiloko vamakwavo wa Yosefa va khume va rhelela va ya etikweni ra Egipta va ya xava koroni	So ten of Joseph's brothers went down to buy grain in Egypt.
kambe Yakobo a nga pfumelanga leswaku Benjamini ndzisana ya Yosefa a famba na vona, hikuva Yakobo a a chava leswaku a nga tshuka a humelele hi khombo.	But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph's brother, with his brothers, for he feared that harm might happen to him.
Hi ndlela leyi, vana va Yakobo va longoloka ni van'wana va ya eku singileni hikwalaho ka ndlala leyi a yi ri kona etikweni ra Kanana.	Thus the sons of Israel came to buy among the others who came, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
Enkarhini wolowo, Yosefa a a ri murhangeri wa tiko ra Egipta; hi yena loyi a a xavisela vanhu hinkwavo koroni. Kutani vamakwavo wa yena va ta, va fika va nkhinsama emahlweni ka yena, va languta hansi.	Now Joseph was governor over the land. He was the one who sold to all the people of the land. And Joseph's brothers came and bowed themselves before him with their faces to the ground.
Loko Yosefa a vona vamakwavo, a hatla a va tiva, kambe a tiendla loyi a nga va tiviki, a vulavula na vona hi ku va karihela, a ku: Mi huma kwihi xana? Vona va ku: Hi huma etikweni ra Kanana; hi tile ku ta xava swakudya.	Joseph saw his brothers and recognized them, but he treated them like strangers and spoke roughly to them. Where do you come from? he said. They said, From the land of Canaan, to buy food.
Hi mukhuva lowu, Yosefa a tiva vamakwavo, kambe vona va nga n'wi tivi.	And Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him.
Hiloko Yosefa a tsundzuka milorho leyi a tshamaka a yi lorha hi tlhelo ra vona, kutani a ku ka vona: N'wina mi tinhlori, mi tile ku ta valanga tiko ra hina mi vona laha ri pfulekeke kona.	And Joseph remembered the dreams that he had dreamed of them. And he said to them, You are spies; you have come to see the nakedness of the land.
Vona va ku ka yena: E-e, we n'wini wa hina. Hina malandza ya wena hi tile ku ta xava swakudya.	They said to him, No, my lord, your servants have come to buy food.
Hinkwerhu hi vana va munhu un'we, hi vanhu vo tshembeka; hina malandza ya wena, a hi tinhlori.	We are all sons of one man. We are honest men. Your servants have never been spies.
Yosefa a ku ka vona: Ma hemba, n'wina mi lo tela ku ta valanga tiko, ku vona laha ri pfulekeke kona.	He said to them, No, it is the nakedness of the land that you have come to see.
Vona va ku: Hina malandza ya wena, hi tswariwile hi ri 12, hi vana va munhu un'we kwale tikweni ra Kanana. Lontsongo ú sale na tatana, kasi makwerhu loyi un'wana a nga ha ri kona.	And they said, We, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan, and behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is no more.
Kambe Yosefa a ku ka vona: A ndzi hembi loko ndzi ku mi tinhlori.	But Joseph said to them, It is as I said to you. You are spies.
Mi ta kamberiwa hi ndlela leyi: Ndzi hlambanya hi vito ra Faro ndzi ri, loko mi nga tisi ndzisana ya n'wina, a mi nga suki endhawini leyi.	By this you shall be tested: by the life of Pharaoh, you shall not go from this place unless your youngest brother comes here.
Rhumani un'wana wa n'wina a ya vitana makwenu. Kambe n'wina van'wana mi ta tshama ekhotsweni, mi kamberiwa ku vona loko leswi mi swi vulaka swi ri ntiyiso; loko swi nga ri tano, ndzi hlambanya hi vito ra Faro ndzi ri, mi tinhlori!	Send one of you, and let him bring your brother, while you remain confined, that your words may be tested, whether there is truth in you. Or else, by the life of Pharaoh, surely you are spies.
Kutani Yosefa a va pfalela hinkwavo ekhotsweni, va tshama kona masiku manharhu.	And he put them all together in custody for three days.
Hi siku lera vunharhu, Yosefa a ku ka vona: Mina ndzi munhu loyi a chavaka Xikwembu; loko mo endla leswi ndzi nga ta mi byela swona, ndzi ta mi tsetselela	On the third day Joseph said to them, Do this and you will live, for I fear God
Ku komba leswaku mi vanhu vo tshembeka, un'wana wa n'wina a a sale a ri mubohiwa endlwini leyi mi pfaleriweke eka yona. Kutani n'wina van'wana rhwalani koroni mi yisela mindyangu ya n'wina leyi karhatiwaka hi ndlala.	if you are honest men, let one of your brothers remain confined where you are in custody, and let the rest go and carry grain for the famine of your households
Kutani mi vuya haleno ni ndzisana ya n'wina. Hi ndlela leyi, ntiyiso wa leswi mi swi vulaka wu ta tikomba, kutani a mi nga dlawi! Hiloko va pfumela ku endla sweswo.	and bring your youngest brother to me. So your words will be verified, and you shall not die. And they did so.
Kutani va byelana va ku: Hi le khombyeni! Hi tivangele nandzu hi tlhelo ra makwerhu Yosefa, hikuva hi vonile ku karhateka ka yena emoyeni loko a kombela ku tsetseleriwa, kambe hi arile ku n'wi yingisa. Hi swona leswi swi hi vangelaka maxangu lawa!	Then they said to one another, In truth we are guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he begged us and we did not listen. That is why this distress has come upon us.
Kutani Rhuveni a ku ka vona: A ndzi mi byelanga leswaku hi nga tshuki hi dyohela mufana luya, xana? Kambe n'wina a mi lavanga ku ndzi yingisa. Kutani sweswi, hi le ku biweni hikwalaho ka rifu ra yena.	And Reuben answered them, Did I not tell you not to sin against the boy? But you did not listen. So now there comes a reckoning for his blood.
A va nga swi tivi leswaku Yosefa wa va twa, hikuva loko a vulavula na vona a a tirhisa mutoloki.	They did not know that Joseph understood them, for there was an interpreter between them.
Hiloko Yosefa a hambananyana na vona a ya rila. Loko a vuya, a vulavula na vona, kutani a hlawula Simiyoni exikarhi ka vona, a n'wi boha va ri karhi va swi vona.	Then he turned away from them and wept. And he returned to them and spoke to them. And he took Simeon from them and bound him before their eyes.
Kutani Yosefa a lerisa leswaku minkwama ya vamakwavo yi cheriwa koroni yi tala, ni leswaku mali ya un'wana ni un'wana yi tlherisiwa yi vekiwa esakeni ra yena, ni leswaku va longeriwa timbuva. Kutani swi endlisiwa sweswo.	And Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain, and to replace every man's money in his sack, and to give them provisions for the journey. This was done for them.
Hiloko va teka masaka ya vona ya koroni va rhwexa timbhongolo ta vona, va suka va famba.	Then they loaded their donkeys with their grain and departed.
Loko va fika laha va nga etlela kona vusiku byebyo, un'wana wa vona a pfula saka, a nusela mbhongolo ya yena eswakudya, kutani a kuma mali ya yena enon'weni wa saka.	And as one of them opened his sack to give his donkey fodder at the lodging place, he saw his money in the mouth of his sack.
Hiloko a ku ka vamakwavo: Mali ya mina yi tlherisiwile, hi yaleyi kwala non'weni wa saka! Loko va twa sweswo, va langutana va ri karhi va rhurhumela hi ku chava, va ku: I mhaka muni leyi Xikwembu xi nga hi endla yona xana?	He said to his brothers, My money has been put back; here it is in the mouth of my sack! At this their hearts failed them, and they turned trembling to one another, saying, What is this that God has done to us?
Loko va fika etikweni ra Kanana, va rungulela Yakobo tata wa vona swilo hinkwaswo leswi swi va humeleleke, va ku	When they came to Jacob their father in the land of Canaan, they told him all that had happened to them, saying
Wanuna loyi a nga murhangeri wa tiko ra Egipta, a a vulavula na hina hi ku hi karihela, a ku hi tinhlori etikweni ra yena.	The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly to us and took us to be spies of the land.
Kambe hina hi kaneta, hi ku: ‘E-e, hina a hi tinhlori, hi vanhu vo tshembeka.	But we said to him, 'We are honest men; we have never been spies.
Hinkwerhu ka hina a hi ri majaha ya 12, vana va tatana un'we; makwerhu loyi un'wana a nga ha ri kona, kasi lontsongo ú sele na tatana etikweni ra Kanana.’	We are twelve brothers, sons of our father. One is no more, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.'
Kutani wanuna lowa murhangeri wa tiko ra Egipta a ku ka hina: ‘Ndlela leyi ndzi nga ta tiva ha yona leswaku mi vanhu vo tshembeka, hi leyi: Un'wana wa n'wina a a sale kwala, kutani n'wina van'wana rhwalani koroni mi khoma ndlela mi famba, mi yisela mindyangu ya n'wina leyi karhatiwaka hi ndlala.	Then the man, the lord of the land, said to us, 'By this I shall know that you are honest men: leave one of your brothers with me, and take grain for the famine of your households, and go your way.
Kutani mi vuya ni ndzisana ya n'wina; hi kona ndzi nga ta pfumela leswaku a mi tinhlori, kambe mi vanhu vo tshembeka, kutani ndzi ta mi ntshunxela makwenu, mi xava ni leswi mi swi lavaka laha tikweni.’ 	Bring your youngest brother to me. Then I shall know that you are not spies but honest men, and I will deliver your brother to you, and you shall trade in the land.'
Loko va pfula masaka ya vona va chulula koroni, un'wana ni un'wana o kuma xiputsa xa mali ya yena endzeni ka saka. Hiloko vona ni tata wa vona va tshuka ngopfu.	As they emptied their sacks, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack. And when they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid.
Kutani Yakobo tata va vona a ku: Mi ndzi hetela vana: Yosefa a nga ha ri kona, na Simiyoni a nga ha ri kona. Namuntlha mi lava ku teka na Benjamini! Swilo leswi hinkwaswo swi ndzi heta matimba.	And Jacob their father said to them, You have bereaved me of my children: Joseph is no more, and Simeon is no more, and now you would take Benjamin. All this has come against me.
Kambe Rhuveni a ku ka tata wa yena: Benjamini, n'wi veke emavokweni ya mina, ndzi ta vuya na yena. Loko ndzo ka ndzi nga vuyi na yena, teka vana va mina va vafana u va dlaya.	Then Reuben said to his father, Kill my two sons if I do not bring him back to you. Put him in my hands, and I will bring him back to you.
Kambe Yakobo a ku: N'wananga Benjamini, mi nge fambi na yena, hikuva hosi ya yena Yosefa ú file. Benjamini ú lo sala a ri yexe. Loko a nga tshuka a humelela hi khombo eriendzweni leri mi nga ta va na rona, mi ta va mi ndzi vangele ku fa hi mbitsi eku dyuhaleni ka mina.	But he said, My son shall not go down with you, for his brother is dead, and he is the only one left. If harm should happen to him on the journey that you are to make, you would bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.
Enkarhini lowu, ndlala a yi ya yi nyanya etikweni.	Now the famine was severe in the land.
Kuteloko koroni leyi va vuyeke na yona hi le Egipta yi herile, Yakobo tata wa vona a ku ka vona: Mo tlhelela le Egipta, mi ya hi xavela swakudyanyana.	And when they had eaten the grain that they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, Go again, buy us a little food.
Kambe Yuda a ku ka yena: Wanuna luya ú hi tsundzuxile swinene, a ku: ‘Loko mo ka mi nga vuyi na makwenu, mina mi nge ndzi voni!’	But Judah said to him, The man solemnly warned us, saying, 'You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.'
Loko wo pfumela leswaku hi famba na Benjamini, hi ta rhelela hi ya ku xavela swakudya.	If you will send our brother with us, we will go down and buy you food.
Kambe loko u ala, hina hi nge yi eku xaveni, hikuva wanuna luya ú te: ‘Loko mo ka mi nga vuyi na makwenu, mina mi nge ndzi voni!’ 	But if you will not send him, we will not go down, for the man said to us, 'You shall not see my face, unless your brother is with you.'
Yakobo a ku: Mhaka leyi mi ndzi vangeleke yona yi bihile ngopfu. A mi n'wi byelela ku yini wanuna wa kona leswaku mi ni makwenu un'wana xana?	Israel said, Why did you treat me so badly as to tell the man that you had another brother?
Va hlamula va ku: Wanuna luya ú hi konanisile, a ku: ‘Xana tata wa n'wina wa ha ri kona xana? Xana mi ni makwenu un'wana xana?’ Leswi hina hi n'wi byeleke swona, a ho hlamula swivutiso sweswo. Xana hina a hi ta swi tivisa ku yini leswaku ú ta lava ku tiseriwa makwerhu, xana?	They replied, The man questioned us carefully about ourselves and our kindred, saying, 'Is your father still alive? Do you have another brother?' What we told him was in answer to these questions. Could we in any way know that he would say, 'Bring your brother down'?
Kutani Yuda a engeta a ku ka Yakobo tata wa yena: Hi pfumelele hi famba ni mufana loyi, leswaku hi ta ka hi nga fi hi ndlala, hina na wena swin'we ni vana va hina.	And Judah said to Israel his father, Send the boy with me, and we will arise and go, that we may live and not die, both we and you and also our little ones.
Mina ndza tiboha hi ku hlambanya, ndzi ri: N'wi veke emavokweni ya mina. Loko o ka a nga vuyi, nandzu a wu ve na mina hilaha ku nga heriki.	I will be a pledge of his safety. From my hand you shall require him. If I do not bring him back to you and set him before you, then let me bear the blame forever.
Loko a wo ka u nga hi hlwerisanga, ingi sweswi hi yile kambirhi.	If we had not delayed, we would now have returned twice.
Kutani tata wa vona Yakobo a ku ka vona: Hiswona, leswi timhaka ti yimeke hi ndlela leyi, endlani leswi: Longani swilo swo saseka leswi kumekaka kwala tikweni, mi rhwala mi famba na swona, mi ya nyika nkulukumba luya. Tekani mirhi ya nkoka ni ya risuna ya tinxaka-xaka, ni vulombenyana, ni mihandzu ya murhi wa alimondi.	Then their father Israel said to them, If it must be so, then do this: take some of the choice fruits of the land in your bags, and carry a present down to the man, a little balm and a little honey, gum, myrrh, pistachio nuts, and almonds.
Naswona mi famba ni mali yo ringana ni leyi mi fambeke na yona eku sunguleni, kasi leyi mi yi kumeke emasakeni ya n'wina, tlhelani na yona, kumbexana mi tlheriseriwile yona hi xihoxo.	Take double the money with you. Carry back with you the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks. Perhaps it was an oversight.
Tekani ni makwenu Benjamini, mi famba mi tlhelela eka wanuna luya.	Take also your brother, and arise, go again to the man.
Xikwembu-xa-matimba-hinkwawo a xi endle leswaku munhu loyi a mi tsetselela, a mi pfumelela ku vuya na makwenu lowun'wana, na Benjamini, kambe loko va lava ku ndzi dlayela vana, a va va dlaye!	May God Almighty grant you mercy before the man, and may he send back your other brother and Benjamin. And as for me, if I am bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.
Hiloko vana va Yakobo va teka tinyiko, ni mali yo tlula leyo sungula kambirhi, va teka na Benjamini, kutani va khoma ndlela va kongoma etikweni ra Egipta, va fika va tikomba eka Yosefa.	So the men took this present, and they took double the money with them, and Benjamin. They arose and went down to Egypt and stood before Joseph.
Loko Yosefa a vona Benjamini exikarhi ka vona, a lerisa mulanguteri wa muti wa yena, a ku: Famba ni vanhu lava ekaya, u fika u tlhava xifuwo, u sweka swakudya, hikuva va ta dya le ka hina ninhlekanhi.	When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, Bring the men into the house, and slaughter an animal and make ready, for the men are to dine with me at noon.
Kutani mulanguteri a endla hilaha a lerisiweke hakona, a ya na vona emutini wa Yosefa.	The man did as Joseph told him and brought the men to Joseph's house.
Loko va ri karhi va yisiwa emutini lowu, va sungula ku chava va ku: Hi tisiwa haleno hikwalaho ka mali leyi tlherisiweke yi vekiwa emasakeni ya hina; wanuna loyi ú lava ndlela yo hi khoma, a hi endla mahlonga, a hi tekela ni timbhongolo.	And the men were afraid because they were brought to Joseph's house, and they said, It is because of the money, which was replaced in our sacks the first time, that we are brought in, so that he may assault us and fall upon us to make us servants and seize our donkeys.
Kuteloko va fika enyangweni ya yindlu, va vulavula ni mulanguteri wa muti wa Yosefa, va ku ka yena	So they went up to the steward of Joseph's house and spoke with him at the door of the house
We n'wini wa hina, hi hina hi nga tshama hi ta hi ta xava swakudya.	and said, Oh, my lord, we came down the first time to buy food.
Kambe loko hi ntshunxa masaka ya hina laha hi fikeke hi etlela kona, un'wana ni un'wana wa hina ú kumile mali ya yena hinkwayo enon'weni wa saka ra yena, kutani sweswi hi te na yona mali ya kona.	And when we came to the lodging place we opened our sacks, and there was each man's money in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight. So we have brought it again with us
Naswona hi te na yin'wana mali yo ta xava ha yona swakudya. A hi tivi leswaku a nga va a ri mani loyi a ngheniseke mali ya hina emasakeni ya hina.	and we have brought other money down with us to buy food. We do not know who put our money in our sacks.
Kutani mulanguteri a hlamula a ku: A ku na xo karhata, mi nga chavi; xi ta va xi ri Xikwembu xa n'wina, xona Xikwembu xa tata wa n'wina, lexi ngheniseke xuma emasakeni ya n'wina; loko yi ri mali ya n'wina, yi fikile eka mina. Kutani a humesa Simiyoni, a n'wi tisa laha a va ri kona.	He replied, Peace to you, do not be afraid. Your God and the God of your father has put treasure in your sacks for you. I received your money. Then he brought Simeon out to them.
Kutani mulanguteri a va nghenisa endlwini, a va nyika mati va hlamba milenge, a tlhela a nyika timbhongolo ta vona swakudya swa tona	And when the man had brought the men into Joseph's house and given them water, and they had washed their feet, and when he had given their donkeys fodder
kutani vona va lulamisa tinyiko leti va nga ta ti humesela Yosefa loko a fika ninhlekanhi, hikuva a va swi twile leswaku va ta dya eka Yosefa.	they prepared the present for Joseph's coming at noon, for they heard that they should eat bread there.
Loko Yosefa a fika ekaya, va teka tinyiko leti a va ri na tona, va n'wi yisela, va fika va nkhinsama emahlweni ka yena.	When Joseph came home, they brought into the house to him the present that they had with them and bowed down to him to the ground.
Kutani Yosefa a va pfuxela, a ku: Xana mukhalabye, tata wa n'wina loyi mi vulavuleke ha yena, wa ha pfukile xana? Xana wa ha ri kona ni sweswi xana?	And he inquired about their welfare and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?
Vona va hlamula va ku: Tatana, yena nandza wa wena, wa ha pfukile, wa ha hanya ni sweswi. Kutani va korhamela hansi, va n'wi nkhinsamela.	They said, Your servant our father is well; he is still alive. And they bowed their heads and prostrated themselves.
Loko Yosefa a tlakusa mahlo, o vona makwavo Benjamini, yena loyi va mameke vele rin'we. Kutani Yosefa a ku: Xana loyi hi yena ndzisana ya n'wina, loyi mi ndzi byeleke yena xana? Xikwembu a xi ve na wena n'wananga!	And he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me? God be gracious to you, my son!
Hiloko Yosefa a hatlisa a huma, hikuva mbilu ya yena a yi khapa hi ntsako wo vona makwavo, kutani a a lava ni ku rila, hiloko a ya nghena laha a etlelaka kona, a rilela kona.	Then Joseph hurried out, for his compassion grew warm for his brother, and he sought a place to weep. And he entered his chamber and wept there.
Kuteloko Yosefa a hlambile xikandza, a huma a ri karhi a ringeta ku tikhoma, a ku: Phamelani swakudya!	Then he washed his face and came out. And controlling himself he said, Serve the food.
Yosefa va n'wi phamela a dyela etlhelo a ri yexe, kasi vamakwavo na vona va phameriwa etlhelo va ri voxe, hambi va ri Vaegipta va dyela etlhelo va ri voxe, hikuva Vaegipta a va dyi swakudya swin'we ni Vaheveru; sweswo swa yila eka Vaegipta.	They served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because the Egyptians could not eat with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the Egyptians.
Vamakwavo wa Yosefa a va tshamisiwile emahlweni ka yena hi ku tlhandlamana ka vona, ku sungula hi mativula ku ya hetelela hi rikotse. Kutani va langutana va ri karhi va hlamala.	And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth. And the men looked at one another in amazement.
Nyama leyi a va phameriwa yona, a yi huma etafuleni ra Yosefa, kutani Benjamini a nyikiwa yo tlula ya lavan'wana kantlhanu. Kutani va nwa vhinyo na Yosefa va tixurhela.	Portions were taken to them from Joseph's table, but Benjamin's portion was five times as much as any of theirs. And they drank and were merry with him.
Kutani Yosefa a lerisa mulanguteri wa muti wa yena, a ku: Chela swakudya emasakeni ya vanhu lava, u chela hilaha va nga kotaka ku rhwala hakona, kutani u veka mali ya un'wana na un'wana kusuhi ni nomo wa saka ra yena.	Then he commanded the steward of his house, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put each man's money in the mouth of his sack
Kutani esakeni ra lontsongo wa kona, u veka xinwelo xa mina lexa silivhere, kusuhi ni nomo wa rona, ni mali leyi a a tile ku ta xava koroni hi yona. Kutani lowa mulanguteri a endla hilaha Yosefa a n'wi leriseke hakona.	and put my cup, the silver cup, in the mouth of the sack of the youngest, with his money for the grain. And he did as Joseph told him.
Kuteloko va lerile nimixo, vamakwavo wa Yosefa va khoma ndlela va famba ni timbhongolo ta vona.	As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away with their donkeys.
Loko va ha ku suka emutini, va nga si ya kule, Yosefa a ku ka mulanguteri wa muti wa yena: Tsutsuma u landza vanhu lavaya! Loko u va kuma, u ta ku ka vona: ‘Hikwalaho ka yini mi endla leswo biha, kasi mina ndzi mi endlerile leswinene xana? Mi yivela yini xinwelo xa n'wini wa mina lexa silivhere xana?	They had gone only a short distance from the city. Now Joseph said to his steward, Up, follow after the men, and when you overtake them, say to them, 'Why have you repaid evil for good?
Xinwelo lexi, hi xona n'wini wa mina a nwaka ha xona, naswona ú tirhisa xona loko a vhumbha. Leswi mi swi endleke, swi bihile!’ 	Is it not from this that my lord drinks, and by this that he practices divination? You have done evil in doing this.'
Loko mulanguteri a va kuma, a vulavula na vona hi mukhuva wolowo.	When he overtook them, he spoke to them these words.
Vona va n'wi hlamula va ku: We n'wini wa hina, hikwalaho ka yini u vulavula hi ndlela leyi xana? Mhaka leyi u yi vulaka, hina malandza ya wena hi nge pfuki hi yi endlile ni siku ni rin'we.	They said to him, Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from your servants to do such a thing!
Vona! Mali leyi hi yi kumeke emasakeni ya hina, hi vuyile na yona hi le tikweni ra Kanana, hi ku tlherisela yona. Loko swi ri tano, xana hi nga yiva silivhere kumbe nsuku emutini wa n'wini wa wena, xana?	Behold, the money that we found in the mouths of our sacks we brought back to you from the land of Canaan. How then could we steal silver or gold from your lord's house?
We n'wini wa hina, loyi xinwelo xi nga ta kumeka xi ri na yena, exikarhi ka hina malandza ya wena, a a dlayiwe, kutani hina lavan'wana hi ta va mahlonga ya wena.	Whichever of your servants is found with it shall die, and we also will be my lord's servants.
Mulanguteri a hlamula a ku: Leswi mi swi vulaka ndza swi twa, kambe loyi a nga ta va hlonga ra mina, hi loyi xinwelo xi nga ta kumeka eka yena, n'wina lavan'wana, mi ta va mi nga ri na nandzu.	He said, Let it be as you say: he who is found with it shall be my servant, and the rest of you shall be innocent.
Hiloko hinkwavo va hatla va ehlisa masaka ya vona, kutani un'wana na un'wana a ntshunxa ra yena.	Then each man quickly lowered his sack to the ground, and each man opened his sack.
Mulanguteri a sungula ku lava xinwelo, a sukela eka lonkulu, a ya hetelela hi lontsongo. Kutani a xi kuma esakeni ra Benjamini.	And he searched, beginning with the eldest and ending with the youngest. And the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.
Hiloko va handzulela swiambalo swa vona, va rhwexa timbhongolo nakambe, va tlhelela emutini.	Then they tore their clothes, and every man loaded his donkey, and they returned to the city.
Loko Yuda ni vamakwavo va fika emutini wa Yosefa, va kuma Yosefa a ha ri kona, kutani va tiwisela hansi emahlweni ka yena.	When Judah and his brothers came to Joseph's house, he was still there. They fell before him to the ground.
Yosefa a ku ka vona: I mhaka muni leyi mi yi endleke xana? Xana a mi swi tivi leswaku ndzi munhu la kotaka ku femba xana?	Joseph said to them, What deed is this that you have done? Do you not know that a man like me can indeed practice divination?
Yuda a ku: Xana hi nga vula yini, we n'wini wanga? A ha ha ri na nomo, hi nge kaneti leswaku hi ni nandzu hikuva i Xikwembu lexi boxeke nandzu wa hina malandza ya wena. We n'wini wanga, hinkwerhu hi mahlonga ya wena, ku katsa ni loyi xinwelo xi kumekeke eka yena.	And Judah said, What shall we say to my lord? What shall we speak? Or how can we clear ourselves? God has found out the guilt of your servants; behold, we are my lord's servants, both we and he also in whose hand the cup has been found.
Kambe Yosefa a ku: E-e, sweswo mina ndzi nge pfuki ndzi swi endlile. Munhu loyi xinwelo xi kumekeke eka yena, hi yena ntsena loyi a nga ta va hlonga ra mina; n'wina lavan'wana, tlhelelani eka tata wa n'wina hi ku rhula.	But he said, Far be it from me that I should do so! Only the man in whose hand the cup was found shall be my servant. But as for you, go up in peace to your father.
Kutani Yuda a tshinela eka Yosefa, a ku ka yena: We n'wini wanga, mina nandza wa wena ndzi kombela leswaku u ndzi lombanyana tindleve, ndzi ni rito na wena. U nga tshuki u ndzi hlundzukela. Wena na hosi Faro, ma ringana!	Then Judah went up to him and said, Oh, my lord, please let your servant speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not your anger burn against your servant, for you are like Pharaoh himself.
We n'wini wanga, u tshama u hi vutisa hina malandza ya wena, u ku: ‘Xana tata wa n'wina wa ha ri kona xana? Xana mi ni makwenu un'wana xana?’	My lord asked his servants, saying, 'Have you a father, or a brother?'
Kutani hina hi ku hlamurile, wena n'wini wanga, hi ku: ‘Tatana wa ha ri kona, ú dyuharile swinene; naswona hi ni ndzisana, a nga n'wana loyi tatana a n'wi kumeke eku dyuhaleni ka yena. Makwerhu loyi ú lo sala a ri yexe eka mana wa yena, hosi ya yena a ya ha ri kona, kutani tatana ú n'wi rhandza ngopfu.’	And we said to my lord, 'We have a father, an old man, and a young brother, the child of his old age. His brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother's children, and his father loves him.'
Hiloko wena u ta ku ka hina malandza ya wena: ‘N'wi tiseni haleno, leswaku ndzi ta n'wi vona.’	Then you said to your servants, 'Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes on him.'
Kutani hina hi ku ka wena n'wini wanga: ‘Swi nga ka swi nga endleki leswaku mufana loyi a hambana na tatana, hikuva loko o suka, tatana a nga fa.’	We said to my lord, 'The boy cannot leave his father, for if he should leave his father, his father would die.'
Hiloko wena u ku ka hina malandza ya wena: ‘Loko mo ka mi nga vuyi na ndzisana ya n'wina, mina mi nga ka mi nga ha ndzi voni.’	Then you said to your servants, 'Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you shall not see my face again.'
Loko hi tlhelela eka tatana, yena nandza wa wena, hi fikile hi n'wi hlamusela marito ya wena, we n'wini wanga.	When we went back to your servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.
Kuteloko tatana a ku: ‘Tlhelelani, mi ya mi ya hi xavela swakudyanyana’	And when our father said, 'Go again, buy us a little food,'
hi hlamurile hi ku: ‘Hi ta ya ntsena loko ndzisana ya hina a famba swin'we na hina; ehandle ka swona hi nga ka hi nga yi, hikuva hi nge pfumeleriwi ku vonana ni wanuna luya, loko ndzisana ya hina hi nga ri na yona.’	we said, 'We cannot go down. If our youngest brother goes with us, then we will go down. For we cannot see the man's face unless our youngest brother is with us.'
Kutani tatana, yena nandza wa wena, a ku ka hina: ‘Ma swi tiva leswaku nsati loyi wa mina ú lo ndzi velekela vana vambirhi ntsena va xinuna	Then your servant my father said to us, 'You know that my wife bore me two sons.
un'wana wa vona ú ndzi siyile, kutani hi ku vona ka mina ú ta va a dyiwile hi swiharhi swa nhova; ku sukela nkarhi wolowo a ndza ha tlhelanga ndzi n'wi vona.	One left me, and I said, Surely he has been torn to pieces, and I have never seen him since.
Loko mo teka ni loyi mi famba na yena, kutani a ya humelela hi khombo, mi ta va mi ndzi vangele ku fa hi mbitsi eku dyuhaleni ka mina.’	If you take this one also from me, and harm happens to him, you will bring down my gray hairs in evil to Sheol.'
Ndzi nga ka ndzi nga swi koti ku tlhelela eka tatana, yena nandza wa wena, ndzi nga ri na yena mufana loyi, hikuva hi yena a khomeke vutomi bya tatana.	Now therefore, as soon as I come to your servant my father, and the boy is not with us, then, as his life is bound up in the boy's life
Loko tatana a vona leswaku mufana loyi a nga kona exikarhi ka hina, ú to fela kwalaho, kutani hina malandza ya wena hi ta va hi vangele tatana ku fa hi mbitsi eku dyuhaleni ka yena.	as soon as he sees that the boy is not with us, he will die, and your servants will bring down the gray hairs of your servant our father with sorrow to Sheol.
Mina nandza wa wena ndzi tibohile eka tatana hi ku hlambanya leswaku loko ndzo ka ndzi nga vuyi na yena mufana loyi, nandzu wu ta va na mina, vutomi bya mina hinkwabyo.	For your servant became a pledge of safety for the boy to my father, saying, 'If I do not bring him back to you, then I shall bear the blame before my father all my life.'
Hikokwalaho, mina nandza wa wena, ndzi kombela leswaku ku sala mina ematshan'weni ya mufana loyi, ndzi va hlonga ra wena, we n'wini wanga. Mufana loyi, n'wi tshike a muka ni vamakwerhu.	Now therefore, please let your servant remain instead of the boy as a servant to my lord, and let the boy go back with his brothers.
Mina ndzi nga ka ndzi nga swi koti ku tlhelela eka tatana, loko ndzi nga ri na yena mufana loyi. Ndza chava ku vona tatana a ri karhi a xaniseka.	For how can I go back to my father if the boy is not with me? I fear to see the evil that would find my father.
Loko Yosefa a nga ha koti ku tikhoma emahlweni ka hinkwavo lava a a ri na vona, a lerisa hi rito lerikulu, a ku: Humesani vanhu hinkwavo! Hikokwalaho, loko Yosefa a titivisa eka vamakwavo, a ku nga ha ri na vanhu van'wana.	Then Joseph could not control himself before all those who stood by him. He cried, Make everyone go out from me. So no one stayed with him when Joseph made himself known to his brothers.
Kutani Yosefa a rila a ba huwa, Vaegipta va kondza va n'wi twa ku ya fika ni le mutini wa hosi Faro.	And he wept aloud, so that the Egyptians heard it, and the household of Pharaoh heard it.
Kutani Yosefa a ku ka vamakwavo: Hi mina Yosefa. Xana tatana wa ha ri kona xana? Kambe vamakwavo va tsandzeka ku n'wi hlamula, hikuva a va tshukile ngopfu loko va tikuma va ri emahlweni ka Yosefa.	And Joseph said to his brothers, I am Joseph! Is my father still alive? But his brothers could not answer him, for they were dismayed at his presence.
Kambe Yosefa a ku: Ndzi kombela leswaku mi tshinela haleno kusuhi na mina. Hiloko va tshinela, kutani Yosefa a ku: Hi mina makwenu Yosefa loyi mi n'wi xaviseke etikweni ra Egipta.	So Joseph said to his brothers, Come near to me, please. And they came near. And he said, I am your brother, Joseph, whom you sold into Egypt.
Mi nga vileli, naswona mi nga tiveki nandzu, hi mhaka ya leswi mi ndzi xaviseke haleno: I Xikwembu lexi ndzi rhangiseke emahlweni ka n'wina, ndzi ta haleno leswaku ndzi ta ponisa vanhu.	And now do not be distressed or angry with yourselves because you sold me here, for God sent me before you to preserve life.
Sweswi swi endla malembe mambirhi hi ri ni ndlala emisaveni, kambe ka ha ta va ni malembe ya ntlhanu lawa vanhu va nga ta ka va nga rimi, naswona va nga ta ka va nga tshoveli nchumu.	For the famine has been in the land these two years, and there are yet five years in which there will be neither plowing nor harvest.
Xikwembu xi ndzi rhangisile emahlweni ka n'wina, leswaku ndzi ta ponisa lavo tala va n'wina, ni leswaku mi ta ka mi nga fi mi nyamalala laha misaveni.	And God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant on earth, and to keep alive for you many survivors.
Hikokwalaho a hi n'wina mi ndzi tiseke haleno, kambe i Xikwembu, kutani xi ndzi vekile ku va tatana eka Faro, ni mulanguteri wa muti wa yena hinkwawo, ni murhangeri wa tiko hinkwaro ra Egipta.	So it was not you who sent me here, but God. He has made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house and ruler over all the land of Egypt.
Hatlisani mi tlhelela eka tatana, mi ya n'wi byela leswaku mina n'wana wa yena Yosefa ndzi ri: ‘Xikwembu xi ndzi vekile ku va murhangeri wa tiko hinkwaro ra Egipta, kutani hatlisa u ta haleno ka mina.	Hurry and go up to my father and say to him, 'Thus says your son Joseph, God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me; do not tarry.
U ta fika u tshama emugangeni wa Goxeni, kutani u ta va kusuhi na mina, wena ni vana va wena ni vatukulu va wena, ni swifuwo swa wena leswikulu ni leswitsongo, ni swilo leswi u nga na swona.	You shall dwell in the land of Goshen, and you shall be near me, you and your children and your children's children, and your flocks, your herds, and all that you have.
Loko u ri kwala, ndzi ta kota ku ku nyika swakudya, hikuva ka ha ta va ni malembe ya ntlhanu ya ndlala, kutani u nga sika, wena ni ndyangu wa wena ni swifuwo swa wena hinkwaswo.’ 	There I will provide for you, for there are yet five years of famine to come, so that you and your household, and all that you have, do not come to poverty.'
Yosefa a ya emahlweni a ku: Ma swi vona hinkwenu, na wena makwerhu Benjamini wa swi vona, leswaku hi mina hi xiviri ndzi vulavulaka.	And now your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see, that it is my mouth that speaks to you.
Mi fika mi byela tatana leswaku ndzi munhu wo chaviseka ngopfu laha tikweni ra Egipta, mi n'wi hlamusela ni swilo hinkwaswo leswi mi swi voneke. Hatlisani mi famba, mi ya teka tatana mi ta na yena haleno.	You must tell my father of all my honor in Egypt, and of all that you have seen. Hurry and bring my father down here.
Kutani Yosefa a vukarha makwavo Benjamini, a rila, na yena Benjamini a rila a vukarhile makwavo Yosefa.	Then he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck and wept, and Benjamin wept upon his neck.
Yosefa a ntswontswa vamakwavo hinkwavo, a va vukarha a ri karhi a rila. Endzhaku ka swona, vamakwavo va vulavula na yena.	And he kissed all his brothers and wept upon them. After that his brothers talked with him.
Loko marungula ya ku ta ka vamakwavo wa Yosefa ma ya fika emutini wa hosi Faro, a tsaka swinene kun'we ni malandza ya yena.	When the report was heard in Pharaoh's house, Joseph's brothers have come, it pleased Pharaoh and his servants.
Kutani hosi Faro a byela Yosefa a ku: Tivisa vamakwenu leswaku mina Faro ndzi ri: ‘Rhwexani swifuwo swa n'wina, mi tlhelela etikweni ra Kanana	And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Say to your brothers, 'Do this: load your beasts and go back to the land of Canaan
mi fika mi teka tata wa n'wina, ni mindyangu ya n'wina, mi vuya haleno tikweni ra mina, ndzi ta mi nyika ndhawu yo saseka laha tikweni ra Egipta, kutani mi ta dya mafurha laha tikweni leri.’	and take your father and your households, and come to me, and I will give you the best of the land of Egypt, and you shall eat the fat of the land.'
Tlhandlakambirhi, byela vamakwenu leswaku ndza va lerisa ndzi ri: ‘Tekani tigolonyi laha tikweni ra Egipta, mi famba na tona, ti ta khandziya hi vana va n'wina ni vasati va n'wina, naswona mi teka tata wa n'wina mi vuya na yena.	And you, Joseph, are commanded to say, 'Do this: take wagons from the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.
Mi nga tshuki mi kanakana hi tlhelo ra leswi mi nga ta swi siya, hikuva swilo leswo saseka etikweni hinkwaro ra Egipta swi ta va swa n'wina.’ 	Have no concern for your goods, for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.'
Kutani vana va Yakobo va endla hilaha va lerisiweke hakona; Yosefa a va nyika tigolonyi hi ku landza xileriso xa hosi Faro, a va longela ni timbuva ta ndlela.	The sons of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the command of Pharaoh, and gave them provisions for the journey.
Yosefa a nyika un'wana ni un'wana wa vona xiambalo xo ncinca ha xona, kambe Benjamini yena a n'wi nyika mali ya tisilivhere ta 300, ni swiambalo swa ntlhanu swo ncinca ha swona	To each and all of them he gave a change of clothes, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred shekels of silver and five changes of clothes.
a rhumela tata wa yena timbhongolo ta khume ti rhwele swilo leswo saseka swa tiko ra Egipta, ni tin'wana ta mantswele ta khume ti rhwele koroni, ni xinkwa, ni swakudya swin'wana leswi swi nga ta va timbuva ta yena ta ndlela.	To his father he sent as follows: ten donkeys loaded with the good things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain, bread, and provision for his father on the journey.
Kutani Yosefa a lelana ni vamakwavo. Loko va lava ku suka, a ku ka vona: Mi nga tshuki mi holova endleleni!	Then he sent his brothers away, and as they departed, he said to them, Do not quarrel on the way.
Hiloko va suka etikweni ra Egipta, va famba va kondza va ya fika eka tata wa vona etikweni ra Kanana.	So they went up out of Egypt and came to the land of Canaan to their father Jacob.
Vana va Yakobo lava yeke etikweni ra Egipta na tata wa vona, va ri ni mindyangu ya vona, hi lava	These are the names of the sons of Israel who came to Egypt with Jacob, each with his household
Rhuveni, na Simiyoni, na Levhi, na Yuda	Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah
na Isakara, na Zebuloni, na Benjamini	Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin
na Dani, na Neftali, na Gadi, na Asere.	Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.
Vana va Yakobo ni vatukulu va yena hinkwavo a va ri 70, ku katsa na Yosefa loyi a ku ri khale a ri etikweni ra Egipta.	All the descendants of Jacob were seventy persons; Joseph was already in Egypt.
Swi fike laha Yosefa, ni vamakwavo hinkwavo, ni hinkwavo lava kuleke eminkarhini yoleyo, va hundzeke emisaveni.	Then Joseph died, and all his brothers and all that generation.
Kambe vanhu va rixaka ra Israele va tswalelene va andza, ntsengo wa vona wu ya wu kula, matimba ya vona ma engeteleka ngopfu swinene, kutani va tata tiko hinkwaro.	But the people of Israel were fruitful and increased greatly; they multiplied and grew exceedingly strong, so that the land was filled with them.
Loko ku hundzile nkarhi, ku vekiwa hosi leyintshwa etikweni ra Egipta; hosi leyi a yi tivanga nchumu hi Yosefa	Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who did not know Joseph.
kutani yi ku ka vanhu va yona: Ma swi vona leswaku Vaisraele va sungula ku hi tlula hi ku tala ka vona ni matimba ya vona!	And he said to his people, Behold, the people of Israel are too many and too mighty for us.
A hi va endleni hi mano leswaku va nga andzi ngopfu, hikuva loko va tala kutani nyimpi yi tshuka yi humelela, va ta yima ni valala va hina, va lwa na hina, kutani va ta suka etikweni va hi balekela.	Come, let us deal shrewdly with them, lest they multiply, and, if war breaks out, they join our enemies and fight against us and escape from the land.
Hiloko Vaegipta va veka valanguteri, leswaku va xanisa Vaisraele hi ku va rhwexa mintirho yo tika. Kutani Vaisraele va akela Faro miti ya Pitomu na Ramsese yo hlayisela tinhundzu ta yena eka yona.	Therefore they set taskmasters over them to afflict them with heavy burdens. They built for Pharaoh store cities, Pithom and Raamses.
Kambe, hambileswi a va xaniseka, Vaisraele va ya va andza, va tata tiko, kutani Vaegipta va sungula ku va chava.	But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and the more they spread abroad. And the Egyptians were in dread of the people of Israel.
Hikokwalaho, Vaegipta va tirhisa Vaisraele hi tihanyi letikulu	So they ruthlessly made the people of Israel work as slaves
va va xanisa hi ku va nyika mintirho leyo tika ya ku pfuva ndzhope ni ku endla switina, va va nyika ni mintirho ya tinxaka-xaka ya le masin'wini. Emintirhweni leyi hinkwayo, a va va tirhisa hi tihanyi letikulu.	and made their lives bitter with hard service, in mortar and brick, and in all kinds of work in the field. In all their work they ruthlessly made them work as slaves.
Kutani hosi ya Egipta yi lerisa tisungukati timbirhi ta Vaheveru, Xifira na Puwa, yi ku ka tona	Then the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, one of whom was named Shiphrah and the other Puah
Loko mi ri karhi mi pfuna vavasati va Vaheveru eku tintshunxeni ka vona, langutani swinene n'wana leswaku i wa yini: Loko a ri wa mufana, n'wi dlayeni! Kambe loko a ri wa nhwanyana, n'wi tshikeni a hanya.	When you serve as midwife to the Hebrew women and see them on the birthstool, if it is a son, you shall kill him, but if it is a daughter, she shall live.
Kambe vavasati lava va tisungukati a va chava Xikwembu, kutani a va endlanga leswi hosi ya Egipta yi va leriseke swona: Va tshika vana va vafana va hanya.	But the midwives feared God and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them, but let the male children live.
Kavaloko hosi yi va vitana, yi ku ka vona: Mi endlele yini ku tshika vana va vafana va hanya, xana?	So the king of Egypt called the midwives and said to them, Why have you done this, and let the male children live?
Vona va hlamula Faro, va ku: Vavasati va Vaheveru va tiyile, a va fani ni vavasati va Vaegipta! Loko lava va tisungukati va nga si fika eka vona, va va kuma va tintshunxile!	The midwives said to Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women, for they are vigorous and give birth before the midwife comes to them.
Hikokwalaho Xikwembu xi katekisa tisungukati; Vaisraele vona va ya va andza, matimba ya vona ma engeteleka ngopfu.	So God dealt well with the midwives. And the people multiplied and grew very strong.
Naswona Xikwembu xi andzisa mindyangu ya lava va tisungukati, hikuva a va xi kombile xichavo.	And because the midwives feared God, he gave them families.
Kutani Faro a lerisa tiko ra yena hinkwaro, a ku: N'wana un'wana ni un'wana wa mufana loyi a nga ta velekiwa eka Vaheveru, n'wi cukumeteni enambyeni, kambe mi tshika vanhwanyana hinkwavo va hanya!	Then Pharaoh commanded all his people, Every son that is born to the Hebrews you shall cast into the Nile, but you shall let every daughter live.
Enkarhini wolowo, wanuna wa rixaka ra ka Levhi a ya a ya teka nsati erixakeni ra ka vona.	Now a man from the house of Levi went and took as his wife a Levite woman.
Kutani wansati loyi a tika, a veleka n'wana wa mufana; loko a vona leswaku i n'wana loyi a sasekeke swinene, a n'wi fihla tin'hweti tinharhu.	The woman conceived and bore a son, and when she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him three months.
Loko a nga ha koti ku ya emahlweni a fihla n'wana loyi, a lava xibokisana xo endliwa hi tinhlanga, a xi tota ntita ni nhlaka, kutani a nghenisa n'wana endzeni ka xona, a ya xi veka exikarhi ka nhlanga eribuweni ra nambu.	When she could hide him no longer, she took for him a basket made of bulrushes and daubed it with bitumen and pitch. She put the child in it and placed it among the reeds by the river bank.
Kutani makwavo wa xihlangi lexi, wa wanhwanyana, a yimela kulenyana, a endlela ku vona leswi nga ta humelela eka n'wana.	And his sister stood at a distance to know what would be done to him.
Kakuloko n'wana Faro wa wanhwana a ta enambyeni ku ta hlamba, a vona xibokisana exikarhi ka nhlanga; malandza ya yena ya xisati a ma ri karhi ma famba-famba eribuweni ra nambu, kutani n'wana Faro a rhuma un'wana wa vona ku ya teka xibokisana.	Now the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river, while her young women walked beside the river. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her servant woman, and she took it.
Loko a xi funungula, a vona xihlangi xa mufana; xihlangi lexi a xi ri karhi xi rila, kutani n'wana Faro a xi twela vusiwana, a ku: Loyi hi un'wana wa vana va Vaheveru!	When she opened it, she saw the child, and behold, the baby was crying. She took pity on him and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children.
Kutani makwavo wa xihlangi a ta a ta ku ka n'wana Faro: Xana ndzi nga ya ndzi ya ku lavela un'wana wa vavasati va Vaheveru la mamisaka, a ta ku mamisela n'wana xana?	Then his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call you a nurse from the Hebrew women to nurse the child for you?
N'wana Faro a hlamula a ku: Hiswona, yana! Hiloko lowa nhwanyana a ya a ya vitana mana wa xihlangi.	And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. So the girl went and called the child's mother.
Kutani n'wana Faro a ku ka manana loyi: Teka n'wana loyi, u famba na yena u ya ndzi mamisela yena, ndzi ta ku hakela. Kutani wansati a teka xihlangi, a ya xi hlayisa.	And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Take this child away and nurse him for me, and I will give you your wages. So the woman took the child and nursed him.
Loko n'wana a kurile, wansati a n'wi tlherisela eka n'wana Faro, kutani n'wana Faro a n'wi teka a n'wi endla n'wana wa yena, a n'wi thya vito ra Muxe, hikuva a a ku: Ndzi n'wi tsavurile ematini.	When the child grew older, she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. She named him Moses, Because, she said, I drew him out of the water.
Loko Muxe a kurile, a endzela varikwavo siku rin'wana, kutani a vona hilaha va rhwexiwaka mintirho yo tika hakona. A vona na Muegipta a ri karhi a ba un'wana wa Vaheveru.	One day, when Moses had grown up, he went out to his people and looked on their burdens, and he saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his people.
Muxe a halahala matlhelo hinkwawo, kutani loko a nga voni munhu, a dlaya Muegipta loyi, a n'wi celela esaveni.	He looked this way and that, and seeing no one, he struck down the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.
Hi siku leri tlhandlamaka, a tlhela a endzela varikwavo, kutani a kuma Vaheveru vambirhi va ri karhi va lwa; kutani a vutisa loyi a a ri ni xihoxo, a ku: U bela yini warikwenu xana?	When he went out the next day, behold, two Hebrews were struggling together. And he said to the man in the wrong, Why do you strike your companion?
Yena a hlamula a ku: Xana u vekiwile hi mani ku va ndhuna ni mulamuri wa hina xana? Xana u lava ku ndzi dlaya ku fana ni Muegipta loyi u n'wi dlayeke xana? Kavaloko Muxe a khomiwa hi ku chava, kutani a vulavula hi mbilu, a ku: Swi vula leswaku mhaka leyi se ya tiviwa!	He answered, Who made you a prince and a judge over us? Do you mean to kill me as you killed the Egyptian? Then Moses was afraid, and thought, Surely the thing is known.
Loko Faro a twa mhaka leyi, a lava Muxe ku n'wi dlaya; kambe Muxe a balekela Faro, a kongoma etikweni ra Midiyani ku ya tumbela kona, a fika a wisa exihlobyeni.	When Pharaoh heard of it, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from Pharaoh and stayed in the land of Midian. And he sat down by a well.
Yetro muprista wa tiko ra Midiyani a a ri ni vana va vanhwanyana va 7, kutani va ta va ta nwisa swifuwo swa tata wa vona, va fika va kelela mati, va cheletela eswitsengeleni.	Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came and drew water and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.
Kambe ku humelela varisi van'wana va fika va va hlongorisa; kutani Muxe a suka a ya lamulela vanhwanyana lava, a nwisa ni swifuwo swa vona.	The shepherds came and drove them away, but Moses stood up and saved them, and watered their flock.
Loko va fika ekaya, tata wa vona Yetro a va vutisa a ku: Namuntlha swi lo yini mi ngo hatlisa ku vuya xana.	When they came home to their father Reuel, he said, How is it that you have come home so soon today?
Vona va hlamula va ku: Munhu un'wana wa Muegipta ú hi lamulerile eka varisi, a tlhela a hi kelelela mati, a nwisa ni swifuwo swa hina.	They said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds and even drew water for us and watered the flock.
Yetro a ku ka vana va yena: Ú kwihi munhu loyi ke? Mi n'wi siyele yini xana? N'wi vitaneni a ta dya swakudya.	He said to his daughters, Then where is he? Why have you left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread.
Kutani Muxe a pfumela ku tshama eka munhu loyi; hiloko a nyika Muxe Sipora n'wana wa yena leswaku a va nsati wa yena.	And Moses was content to dwell with the man, and he gave Moses his daughter Zipporah.
Sipora a veleka n'wana wa mufana, kutani Muxe a n'wi thya vito ra Gerixomu (hileswaku: Ndzi muluveri kwala), hikuva a a ku: Ndzi muluveri etikeweni ra vanhu vambe.	She gave birth to a son, and he called his name Gershom, for he said, I have been a sojourner in a foreign land.
Ku hundza malembe, kutani hosi ya le Egipta yi fa. Vanhu va Israele vona a va konya hikwalaho ka mintirho ya vona leyo tika, va rilela ku lamuleriwa, kutani xirilo xa vona xi ya fika etindleveni ta Xikwembu.	During those many days the king of Egypt died, and the people of Israel groaned because of their slavery and cried out for help. Their cry for rescue from slavery came up to God.
Loko Xikwembu xi twa ku konya ka vona, xi tsundzuka ntwanano wa xona na Abrahama, na Isaka, na Yakobo.	And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.
Xikwembu xi languta vanhu va Israele, kutani xi twisisa matshamelo ya vona.	God saw the people of Israel—and God knew.
Muxe a a risa swifuwo swa mukon'wana wa yena Yetro, muprista wa Midiyani. Siku rin'wana, a tsemakanya mananga ni ntlhambi wa yena, a ya fika eHorebe, entshaveni ya Xikwembu.	Now Moses was keeping the flock of his father-in-law, Jethro, the priest of Midian, and he led his flock to the west side of the wilderness and came to Horeb, the mountain of God.
Kutani ntsumi ya HOSI Xikwembu yi tikomba eka yena yi ri exihlahleni, yi fana ni langavi ra ndzilo. Loko Muxe a xiyisisa, a vona leswaku xihlahla xa vuvumela, kambe a xi tshwi.	And the angel of the LORD appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush. He looked, and behold, the bush was burning, yet it was not consumed.
Embilwini a ku: Ndzi nga ha hambuka, ndzi ya hlalela mahlori lamakulu lawa; hikwalaho ka yini xihlahla xi vuvumela, kambe xi nga tshwi xi hela ke?	And Moses said, I will turn aside to see this great sight, why the bush is not burned.
Loko HOSI Xikwembu xi vona leswaku Muxe ú hambukile ku ya xiyisisa, xi n'wi vitana xi ri exihlahleni, xi ku: Muxe! Muxe! Yena a ku: Hi mina loyi!	When the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called to him out of the bush, Moses, Moses! And he said, Here I am.
Xikwembu xi ku: U nga tshuki u tshinela haleno. Hluvula tintanghu, hikuva laha u yimaka kona i misava leyi hlawulekeke.	Then he said, Do not come near; take your sandals off your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground.
Xi engeta xi ku: Hi mina Xikwembu xa vatata wa wena, xi nga Xikwembu xa Abrahama, na Isaka, na Yakobo. Kavaloko Muxe a tisiva mombo, hikuva a a chava ku languta Xikwembu.	And he said, I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God.
Kutani HOSI yi ku: Ndzi vonile hilaha vanhu va mina lava nga tikweni ra Egipta va xanisiwaka hakona; ndzi twile ni swirilo swa vona hikwalaho ka vafambisi va mintirho, ndzi twisisa ku xaniseka loku va nga na kona.	Then the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters. I know their sufferings
Hikokwalaho, ndzi rhelerile ku ta va lamulela emavokweni ya Vaegipta, ndzi va humesa etikweni leriya, ndzi va yisa etikweni lero nona, leri anameke, tiko leri khulukaka ntswamba ni vulombe, ku nga laha ku akeke Vakanana, ni Vahiti, ni Vaamori, ni Vaperesi, ni Vahivhi, ni Vayebusi.	and I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land to a good and broad land, a land flowing with milk and honey, to the place of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.
Kutani sweswi, leswi ku rila ka vanhu va Israele ku fikeke etindleveni ta mina, ni leswi ndzi voneke hilaha vanhu va Egipta va va xanisaka hakona	And now, behold, the cry of the people of Israel has come to me, and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them.
tana ndzi ta ku rhuma eka Faro, leswaku u ya humesa vanhu va mina va Israele etikweni ra Egipta.	Come, I will send you to Pharaoh that you may bring my people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt.
Kambe Muxe a ku: Ndzo va mani mina ndzi nga ta ya eka Faro, ndzi ya humesa vanhu va Israele etikweni ra Egipta ke?	But Moses said to God, Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the children of Israel out of Egypt?
Kutani Xikwembu xi ku ka yena: Ndzi ta va na wena; xikombiso xa leswaku ndzi ku rhumile xi ta va lexi: Loko u humesile vanhu va Israele etikweni ra Egipta, mi ta ndzi gandzela entshaveni leyi.	He said, But I will be with you, and this shall be the sign for you, that I have sent you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain.
Kavaloko Muxe a ku ka Xikwembu: Loko ndzi fika eka vanhu va Israele, ndzi ku ka vona: ‘Xikwembu xa vatata wa n'wina xi ndzi rhumile eka n'wina’, kutani va ndzi vutisa va ku: ‘Vito ra xona i mani ke?’ xana ndzi ta va hlamula yini xana?	Then Moses said to God, If I come to the people of Israel and say to them, 'The God of your fathers has sent me to you,' and they ask me, 'What is his name?' what shall I say to them?
Kutani Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe: NDZI LOYI NDZI NGA YENA! Xi engeta xi ku: U ta ku ka vanhu va Israele: ‘La vuriwaka NDZI YENA, ú ndzi rhumile eka n'wina.’ 	God said to Moses, I AM WHO I AM. And he said, Say this to the people of Israel: 'I AM has sent me to you.'
Xikwembu xi tlhela xi ku ka Muxe: U ta byela vanhu va Israele, u ku: ‘HOSI, Xikwembu xa vatata wa n'wina, xi nga Xikwembu xa Abrahama, na Isaka, na Yakobo, xi ndzi rhumile eka n'wina.’ Leri hi rona vito ra mina hilaha ku nga heriki, kutani ndzi ta vitaniwa hi rona eka hinkwavo lava nga ta velekiwa.	God also said to Moses, Say this to the people of Israel: 'The LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you.' This is my name forever, and thus I am to be remembered throughout all generations.
Famba u ya hlengeleta vakulukumba va Israele, u va byela leswaku mina HOSI Xikwembu xa vatata wa vona ndzi nga Xikwembu xa Abrahama, na Isaka, na Yakobo, ndzi tikombile eka wena; va byele leswaku ndzi tile ka vona hakunene; ni leswi vanhu va Egipta va va endlaka swona, ndzi swi vonile.	Go and gather the elders of Israel together and say to them, 'The LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, has appeared to me, saying, I have observed you and what has been done to you in Egypt
Kutani ndzi tshembisa leswaku ndzi ta va humesa emaxangwini ya Egipta, ndzi va yisa etikweni ra Vakanana, ni Vahiti, ni Vaamori, ni Vaperesi, ni Vayebusi, ri nga tiko leri khulukaka ntswamba ni vulombe.	and I promise that I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, a land flowing with milk and honey.'
Vakulukumba va Israele va ta pfumela leswi u nga ta va byela swona, kutani va ta ya na wena eka hosi ya Egipta, mi ku ka yona: ‘HOSI Xikwembu, xi nga Xikwembu xa Vaheveru, xi tikombile eka hina, kutani sweswi hi kombela ku teka riendzo ra masiku manharhu, hi ya emananga hi ya humesela HOSI Xikwembu xa hina emagandzelo.’	And they will listen to your voice, and you and the elders of Israel shall go to the king of Egypt and say to him, 'The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us; and now, please let us go a three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.'
Kambe ndza swi tiva leswaku, handle ka loko yi nga lo sindzisiwa hi voko ra matimba, hosi ya Egipta yi nga ka yi nga mi tshiki mi famba.	But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go unless compelled by a mighty hand.
Hikokwalaho, ndzi ta tirhisa matimba ya mina, ndzi ba vanhu va Egipta hi swihlamariso hinkwaswo leswi ndzi nga ta swi endla exikarhi ka vona; endzhaku ka swona, hosi ya Egipta yi ta mi tshika mi famba.	So I will stretch out my hand and strike Egypt with all the wonders that I will do in it; after that he will let you go.
Naswona, ndzi ta endla leswaku n'wina Vaisraele mi tsakeriwa hi Vaegipta; kutani loko mi huma etikweni, a mi nga fambi ntsena, mi ta va mi tamerile swin'wana.	And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians; and when you go, you shall not go empty
Wansati un'wana ni un'wana wa Muisraele ú ta ya a ya kombela swo bomba ha swona swa silivhere ni nsuku, ni swiambalo, eka wansati wa Muegipta la akeke kusuhi na yena ni ka lava luveleke emutini wa kona, kutani mi ta ambexa vana va n'wina va majaha ni vanhwana. Hi ndlela leyi, mi ta tekela Vaegipta swilo swa vona.	but each woman shall ask of her neighbor, and any woman who lives in her house, for silver and gold jewelry, and for clothing. You shall put them on your sons and on your daughters. So you shall plunder the Egyptians.
Kutani Muxe a hlamula Xikwembu, a ku: Ndzi vona wonge Vaisraele a va nga ndzi kholwi, kumbe ku yingisa leswi ndzi nga ta va byela swona, hikuva va ta ku: ‘HOSI Xikwembu a xi tikombanga eka wena.’ 	Then Moses answered, But behold, they will not believe me or listen to my voice, for they will say, 'The LORD did not appear to you.'
Hiloko HOSI Xikwembu xi ku: U khome yini kwalaho xana? Muxe a ku: I nhonga.	The LORD said to him, What is that in your hand? He said, A staff.
Kutani xi ku ka yena: Yi hoxe ehansi! Loko Muxe a yi hoxa ehansi, yi hundzuka nyoka, kutani Muxe a yi chava a tsutsuma.	And he said, Throw it on the ground. So he threw it on the ground, and it became a serpent, and Moses ran from it.
Kambe HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka yena: Tshambuluta voko ra wena u yi khoma hi ncila. Kutani Muxe a yi khoma, yi tlhela yi hundzuka nhonga evokweni ra yena.	But the LORD said to Moses, Put out your hand and catch it by the tail—so he put out his hand and caught it, and it became a staff in his hand
Xikwembu xi ku: Leswi swi ta khorwisa Vaisraele leswaku ndzi tikombile eka wena, mina HOSI Xikwembu xa vatata wa vona, ndzi nga Xikwembu xa Abrahama, na Isaka, na Yakobo.	that they may believe that the LORD, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you.
HOSI Xikwembu xi engeta xi ku: Nghenisa xandla xa wena endzeni ka xiambalo hi le xifuveni xa wena. Muxe a nghenisa, kutani loko a humesa xandla xa yena, a xi basulukile hi vuvabyi bya nhlokonho.	Again, the LORD said to him, Put your hand inside your cloak. And he put his hand inside his cloak, and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous like snow.
Kutani Xikwembu xi ku: Tlhela u nghenisa xandla endzeni ka xiambalo. Muxe a endla tano; loko a xi humesa, a vona leswaku xi tlhele xi va lexinene, xi fana ni miri hinkwawo.	Then God said, Put your hand back inside your cloak. So he put his hand back inside his cloak, and when he took it out, behold, it was restored like the rest of his flesh.
Xikwembu xi ku: Loko va nga ku kholwi, ni loko va nga amukeli xikombiso lexo sungula, nkarhi wun'wana va nga khorwisiwa hi lexa vumbirhi.	If they will not believe you, God said, or listen to the first sign, they may believe the latter sign.
Kambe loko, ha vumbirhi bya swona, swi nga va khorwisi, ni loko va nga amukeli leswi u nga ta va byela swona, u ta ya u ya ka mati enambyeni, u ma halata laha ku omeke, kutani mati lawa ma ta hundzuka ngati.	If they will not believe even these two signs or listen to your voice, you shall take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground, and the water that you shall take from the Nile will become blood on the dry ground.
Kambe Muxe a ku ka HOSI Xikwembu: We N'wini wanga, ku sukela khale mina nandza wa wena a ndzi nyikiwanga hi tlhelo ra ku vulavula; ndza nonoka eku vulavuleni, naswona ndzi ni manghanghamila, kutani hambileswi u vulavuleke na mina, a ku hundzukanga nchumu.	But Moses said to the LORD, Oh, my Lord, I am not eloquent, either in the past or since you have spoken to your servant, but I am slow of speech and of tongue.
Hiloko HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe: Xana i mani la vumbeke nomo wa munhu xana? Xana a hi mina HOSI Xikwembu ndzi endlaka munhu ku va mbheveve, kumbe ku fa tindleve, kumbe ku kota ku vona, kumbe ku va lowo-fe-mahlo, xana?	Then the LORD said to him, Who has made man's mouth? Who makes him mute, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Is it not I, the LORD?
Hikokwalaho, famba sweswi! Mina ndzi ta ku pfuna ku vulavula; ndzi ta ku byela ni leswi u nga ta vula swona.	Now therefore go, and I will be with your mouth and teach you what you shall speak.
Kambe Muxe a ku: We N'wini wanga, rhuma loyi u tsakelaka ku n'wi rhuma!	But he said, Oh, my Lord, please send someone else.
Kavaloko HOSI Xikwembu xi karihela Muxe, xi ku: Xana makwenu Aroni lowa Mulevhi a nga kona xana? Ndza swi tiva leswaku yena ú nyikiwile hi tlhelo ra ku vulavula. Tiva leswaku Aroni ú le ndleleni ku ta hlangana na wena; kutani loko a ku vona, ú ta tsaka swinene.	Then the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses and he said, Is there not Aaron, your brother, the Levite? I know that he can speak well. Behold, he is coming out to meet you, and when he sees you, he will be glad in his heart.
Wena u ta vulavula na yena, u n'wi byela leswi a fanelaka ku vula swona. Loko a ri mina, ndzi ta mi pfuna ku vulavula ha vumbirhi bya n'wina; naswona ndzi ta mi komba leswi mi nga ta endla swona.	You shall speak to him and put the words in his mouth, and I will be with your mouth and with his mouth and will teach you both what to do.
Aroni ú ta vulavula ematshan'wini ya wena, a va nomo wa wena eka vanhu, kutani wena u ta fana ni Xikwembu eka Aroni.	He shall speak for you to the people, and he shall be your mouth, and you shall be as God to him.
Naswona nhonga leyi, u ta famba u yi khomile, u ta endla swihlamariso ha yona.	And take in your hand this staff, with which you shall do the signs.
Kutani Muxe a tlhelela eka Yetro mukon'wana wa yena, a fika a ku: Ndzi kombela ku tlhelela etikweni ra Egipta, ndzi ya pfuxela varikwerhu. Yetro a hlamula Muxe a ku: Hiswona, u ta famba hi ku rhula!	Moses went back to Jethro his father-in-law and said to him, Please let me go back to my brothers in Egypt to see whether they are still alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.
Loko Muxe a ha ri eMidiyani, HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka yena: Tlhelela etikweni ra Egipta, hikuva hinkwavo lava a va lava ku ku dlaya, va file.	And the LORD said to Moses in Midian, Go back to Egypt, for all the men who were seeking your life are dead.
Hiloko Muxe a teka nsati ni vana va yena, a va gadisa mbhongolo, kutani a tlhelela etikweni ra Egipta, a famba a khomile nhonga ya Xikwembu.	So Moses took his wife and his sons and had them ride on a donkey, and went back to the land of Egypt. And Moses took the staff of God in his hand.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe: Loko u tlhelerile etikweni ra Egipta, vona leswaku u endla, emahlweni ka Faro, swihlamariso hinkwaswo leswi ndzi ku nyikeke matimba ya ku swi endla; kambe ndzi ta nonon'hwisa mbilu ya yena, leswaku a nga pfumeleli Vaisraele ku famba.	And the LORD said to Moses, When you go back to Egypt, see that you do before Pharaoh all the miracles that I have put in your power. But I will harden his heart, so that he will not let the people go.
U ta ku ka Faro: ‘HOSI Xikwembu xi vurisa sweswo xi ri: Israele i mativula ya mina	Then you shall say to Pharaoh, 'Thus says the LORD, Israel is my firstborn son
kutani wena Faro, tshika n'wana loyi wa mina wa mativula a famba, a ya ndzi gandzela. Tiva leswaku loko u ala ku n'wi tshika, ndzi ta dlaya n'wana wa wena wa mativula.’ 	and I say to you, Let my son go that he may serve me. If you refuse to let him go, behold, I will kill your firstborn son.'
Loko va ri endleleni, HOSI Xikwembu xi tela Muxe laha va nga fika va gova kona, xi ringeta ku n'wi dlaya.	At a lodging place on the way the LORD met him and sought to put him to death.
Kutani Sipora a teka ribye ro kariha, a tsema nsuvu wa n'wana wa yena, a khumba milenge ya Muxe ha wona, a ku: Hakunene, u nuna wa ngati eka mina.	Then Zipporah took a flint and cut off her son's foreskin and touched Moses' feet with it and said, Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me!
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi tshika Muxe. Loko Sipora a ku: U nuna wa ngati eka mina, a a vulavula a kongomisa mhaka ya ku yimba.	So he let him alone. It was then that she said, A bridegroom of blood, because of the circumcision.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Aroni: Famba a ya hlangana na Muxe emananga. Hiloko Aroni a famba a ya hlangana na Muxe entshaveni ya Xikwembu, a fika a n'wi ntswontswa.	The LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. So he went and met him at the mountain of God and kissed him.
Kutani Muxe a tivisa Aroni hinkwaswo leswi HOSI Xikwembu xi n'wi rhumeke ku ya swi vula, ni swikombiso hinkwaswo leswi xi n'wi byeleke ku ya swi endla.	And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD with which he had sent him to speak, and all the signs that he had commanded him to do.
Kavaloko Muxe na Aroni va ya va ya hlengeleta vakulukumba va Israele hinkwavo.	Then Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the people of Israel.
Kutani Aroni a tivisa vanhu hinkwaswo leswi HOSI Xikwembu xi leriseke Muxe swona, a endla ni swikombiso emahlweni ka vona.	Aaron spoke all the words that the LORD had spoken to Moses and did the signs in the sight of the people.
Kavaloko Vaisraele va kholwa: Loko va twisisile leswaku HOSI Xikwembu xi tile eka vona hakunene, ni leswaku xi vonile ku xaniseka ka vona, va korhamela hansi va xi gandzela.	And the people believed; and when they heard that the LORD had visited the people of Israel and that he had seen their affliction, they bowed their heads and worshiped.
Endzhaku ka swona, Muxe na Aroni va ya eka Faro, va fika va ku: HOSI Xikwembu, xi nga Xikwembu xa Israele, xi vurisa sweswo xi ri: ‘Tshika vanhu va mina va famba, va ya endla nkhuvo emananga va ndzi tlangela.’ 	Afterward Moses and Aaron went and said to Pharaoh, Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'Let my people go, that they may hold a feast to me in the wilderness.'
Kutani Faro a ku: HOSI Xikwembu i mani xana? Hikwalaho ka yini ndzi fanele ku n'wi yingisa, ndzi tshika Vaisraele va famba xana? HOSI Xikwembu, a ndzi n'wi tivi, naswona ndzi nga ka ndzi nga tshiki Vaisraele va famba.	But Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice and let Israel go? I do not know the LORD, and moreover, I will not let Israel go.
Kutani Muxe na Aroni va ku: Xikwembu xa Vaheveru xi tikombile eka hina, kutani hi kombela ku teka riendzo ra masiku manharhu, hi ya emananga ku ya humesela HOSI Xikwembu xa hina emagandzelo; loko swi nga ri tano, xi ta hi ba hi mintungu kumbe hi matlhari.	Then they said, The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please let us go a three days' journey into the wilderness that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God, lest he fall upon us with pestilence or with the sword.
Kambe hosi ya Egipta yi ku: Wena Muxe, na wena Aroni, hikwalaho ka yini mi tshikisa vanhu mintirho ya vona? Tlhelelani emintirhweni ya n'wina!	But the king of Egypt said to them, Moses and Aaron, why do you take the people away from their work? Get back to your burdens.
Faro a ya emahlweni a ku: Vonani, vanhu va ka n'wina va tele ngopfu, kambe n'wina mi lava ku va tshikisa ku tirha!	And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land are now many, and you make them rest from their burdens!
Kutani hi siku rero, Faro a lerisa Vaegipta lava fambisaka mintirho, ni Vaisraele lava nga tindhuna emintirhweni ya kona, a ku	The same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people and their foremen
Mi nga ha yi emahlweni mi nyika vanhu lava va Vaisraele ebyanyi bya tlhongwe lebyi va pfuvaka misava ya switina na byona tanihi masiku; va tshikeni va ya tihlengeletela byona hi voxe.	You shall no longer give the people straw to make bricks, as in the past; let them go and gather straw for themselves.
Kambe ntsengo wa switina leswi a va hamba va swi endla, wu vekiseni sweswo, mi nga wu hunguti nikutsongo! Vanhu lava va loloha, hi swona leswi endlaka leswaku va ba huwa va ku: ‘Hi tshike hi famba hi ya gandzela Xikwembu xa hina!’	But the number of bricks that they made in the past you shall impose on them, you shall by no means reduce it, for they are idle. Therefore they cry, 'Let us go and offer sacrifice to our God.'
Vanhu lava, a va nyikiwe mintirho yo tika, va tshama va karhi va tirha, va ta ka va nga kumi nkarhi wo yingisela mavunwa.	Let heavier work be laid on the men that they may labor at it and pay no regard to lying words.
Vafambisi va mintirho ni tindhuna ta Vaisraele va huma va ya tivisa vanhu, va ku: Faro ú vurisa sweswo, ú ri a nga ka a nga ha mi nyiki byanyi.	So the taskmasters and the foremen of the people went out and said to the people, Thus says Pharaoh, 'I will not give you straw.
Ú ri, fambani mi tilavela byona hi n'wexe, lomu mi nga ta byi kuma kona; kambe ntirho wa n'wina a wu nga hungutiwi nikutsongo.	Go and get your straw yourselves wherever you can find it, but your work will not be reduced in the least.'
Kutani Vaisraele va hangalaka na tiko ra Egipta, va famba va hlengeleta byanyi bya mavivi, hi ku pfumala tlhongwe.	So the people were scattered throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.
Vafambisi va mintirho a va va sala hi le ndzhaku, va ku: Hatlisani mi heta ntirho wa siku lowu mi nga pimeriwa wona, ku fana ni khale loko ma ha nyikiwa byanyi.	The taskmasters were urgent, saying, Complete your work, your daily task each day, as when there was straw.
Vaisraele lava a va vekiwile hi vafambisi va mintirho ya Faro ku va tindhuna ta vatirhi, a va biwa, va vutisiwa leswaku hikwalaho ka yini va nga fikisanga ntsengo wa switina leswi va vekeriweke ku swi endla hi siku, ku fana ni khale.	And the foremen of the people of Israel, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten and were asked, Why have you not done all your task of making bricks today and yesterday, as in the past?
Kutani tindhuna ta Vaisraele ti yisa swirilo swa tona eka Faro, ti ku: Hikwalaho ka yini u khoma malandza ya wena hi ndlela leyi xana?	Then the foremen of the people of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, Why do you treat your servants like this?
Hina malandza ya wena a ha ha nyikiwi byanyi, kambe va phikelela va ku: ‘Endlani switina!’ Nakambe tiva leswaku hina malandza ya wena, ha biwa, kasi ku dyoha vanhu va wena.	No straw is given to your servants, yet they say to us, 'Make bricks!' And behold, your servants are beaten; but the fault is in your own people.
Hiloko Faro a va hlamula a ku: Ma loloha n'wina, a mi tirhi nchumu; hikokwalaho mi ri: ‘Hi tshike hi famba hi ya ganzela HOSI Xikwembu!’	But he said, You are idle, you are idle; that is why you say, 'Let us go and sacrifice to the LORD.'
Tlhelelani emintirhweni ya n'wina; byanyi mi nga ka mi nga nyikiwi, kambe mi fanele ku humesa ntsengo wa switina swo ringana ni swa masiku!	Go now and work. No straw will be given you, but you must still deliver the same number of bricks.
Kutani tindhuna ta Vaisraele ti vona leswaku ti le khombyeni, loko ti byeriwa leswaku ntsengo wa switina leswi va pimeriweke swona hi siku, a wu hungutiwanga.	The foremen of the people of Israel saw that they were in trouble when they said, You shall by no means reduce your number of bricks, your daily task each day.
Loko tindhuna ti vuya hi le ka Faro, ti hlangana na Muxe na Aroni lava a va ta ku ta ti hlanganisa.	They met Moses and Aaron, who were waiting for them, as they came out from Pharaoh
Kutani ti ku ka vona: HOSI Xikwembu a xi mi xiyisise, xi mi ba, hikuva mi hi venganisile na Faro ni malandza ya yena, mi va pfulela ni ndlela yo hi dlaya ha yona.	and they said to them, The LORD look on you and judge, because you have made us stink in the sight of Pharaoh and his servants, and have put a sword in their hand to kill us.
Kutani Muxe a tlhelela eka HOSI Xikwembu, a ku: We HOSI, hikwalaho ka yini u komba vanhu lava emaxangu xana? Hikwalaho ka yini u ndzi rhumile xana?	Then Moses turned to the LORD and said, O Lord, why have you done evil to this people? Why did you ever send me?
Ku sukela loko ndzi yile ndzi ya vula leswi u ndzi leriseke swona eka Faro, yena ú komba vanhu lava emaxangu, kambe wena, a wu endlanga nchumu ku va ponisa.	For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has done evil to this people, and you have not delivered your people at all.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe: Sweswi u ta vona leswi ndzi nga ta swi endla eka Faro: Ndzi ta tirhisa matimba ya mina leswaku Faro a tshika vanhu va Israele va famba. Ina, hi ku sindzisiwa hi mina, ú ta va hlongola kunene, va huma etikweni ra yena.	But the LORD said to Moses, Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh; for with a strong hand he will send them out, and with a strong hand he will drive them out of his land.
Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe: Hi mina HOSI Xikwembu.	God spoke to Moses and said to him, I am the LORD.
Loko ndzi tikombile eka Abrahama, ni le ka Isaka, ni le ka Yakobo, a ndzi tivula ‘Xikwembu-xa-matimba-hinkwawo’; kambe a ndzi titivisanga eka vona hi vito ra mina ra ‘HOSI’.	I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, as God Almighty, but by my name the LORD I did not make myself known to them.
Nakambe ndzi endlile ntwanano exikarhi ka mina na vona, ndzi va tshembisa ku va nyika tiko ra Kanana, tiko leri a va akile eka rona va ri valuveri.	I also established my covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan, the land in which they lived as sojourners.
Kutani sweswi ndzi twile ku konya ka Vaisraele lava endliweke mahlonga hi Vaegipta, ndzi tsundzukile ni ntwanano wa mina.	Moreover, I have heard the groaning of the people of Israel whom the Egyptians hold as slaves, and I have remembered my covenant.
Hikokwalaho tivisa Vaisraele leswaku ndzi ri ka vona: ‘Hi mina HOSI Xikwembu, kutani ndzi ta mi humesa emintirhweni yo tika ya le Egipta, ndzi mi ponisa evuhlongeni bya kona, ndzi mi kutsula hi mintirho ya mina ya matimba ni ku avanyisa loku hlamarisaka.	Say therefore to the people of Israel, 'I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will deliver you from slavery to them, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great acts of judgment.
Naswona ndzi ta mi endla vanhu va mina, mina ndzi va Xikwembu xa n'wina; kutani mi ta swi tiva leswaku hi mina HOSI Xikwembu xa n'wina, lexi nga ta mi humesa emintirhweni yo tika ya le Egipta.	I will take you to be my people, and I will be your God, and you shall know that I am the LORD your God, who has brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.
Kutani ndzi ta mi yisa etikweni leri ndzi hlambanyeke leswaku ndzi ta ri nyika Abrahama, na Isaka, na Yakobo; ndzi ta mi nyika rona ri va ndzhaka ya n'wina. Hi mina HOSI Xikwembu!’ 	I will bring you into the land that I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. I will give it to you for a possession. I am the LORD.'
Muxe a ya vurisa sweswo eka vanhu va Israele, kambe vona a va n'wi yingisanga, hikuva ku tika ka vuhlonga bya vona a ku va heta matimba.	Moses spoke thus to the people of Israel, but they did not listen to Moses, because of their broken spirit and harsh slavery.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe	So the LORD said to Moses
Famba u ya byela Faro hosi ya Egipta, a tshika vanhu va Israele va huma etikweni ra yena.	Go in, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the people of Israel go out of his land.
Kambe Muxe a hlamula HOSI Xikwembu, a ku: Vona, hambi va ri vanhu va Israele, a va ndzi yingisanga; xana Faro yena ú ta ndzi yingisisa ku yini ni manghanghamila ya mina, xana?	But Moses said to the LORD, Behold, the people of Israel have not listened to me. How then shall Pharaoh listen to me, for I am of uncircumcised lips?
Hambiswiritano HOSI Xikwembu xi vulavula na Muxe na Aroni, xi va lerisa leswi va nga ta byela vanhu va Israele swona, xi va lerisa ni ku ya byela Faro hosi ya Egipta leswaku a tshika vanhu va Israele va huma etikweni ra Egipta.	But the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron and gave them a charge about the people of Israel and about Pharaoh king of Egypt: to bring the people of Israel out of the land of Egypt.
Lowu i nongoloko wa tinyimba ta vatata wa Muxe na Aroni:
Vana va Rhuveni, mativula ya Yakobo, hi lava: Hanoko, na Palu, na Hesironi, na Karimi; hi vona va nyimba ya ka Rhuveni.	These are the heads of their fathers' houses: the sons of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi; these are the clans of Reuben.
Vana va Simiyoni hi lava: Yemuwele, na Yamini, na Ohada, na Yakini, na Sohari, na Xawulu loyi mana wa yena a a ri Mukanana; hi vona va nyimba ya ka Simiyoni.	The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul, the son of a Canaanite woman; these are the clans of Simeon.
Vana va Levhi hi ku tlhandlamana ka vona, hi lava: Gerixoni, na Kohata, na Merari; Levhi ú hanyile malembe ya 137.	These are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari, the years of the life of Levi being 137 years.
Vana va Gerixoni hi ku ya hi tindlu ta ka vona, hi lava: Libini, na Ximeyi.	The sons of Gershon: Libni and Shimei, by their clans.
Vana va Kohata hi lava: Amirama, na Yisihara, na Hebroni, na Uziele; Kohata ú hanyile malembe ya 133.	The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, the years of the life of Kohath being 133 years.
Vana va Merari hi lava: Maheli, na Muxi. Lava hi vona va nyimba ya ka Levhi, hi ku tlhandlamana ka vona.	The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. These are the clans of the Levites according to their generations.
Amirama a a tekile Yokebedi makwavo wa tata wa yena; Yokebedi a veleka Aroni na Muxe. Amiramu ú hanyile malembe ya 137.	Amram took as his wife Jochebed his father's sister, and she bore him Aaron and Moses, the years of the life of Amram being 137 years.
Vana va Yisihara hi lava: Kora, na Nefege, na Zikri.	The sons of Izhar: Korah, Nepheg, and Zichri.
Vana va Uziele hi lava: Mixaele, na Elisafani, na Sitri.	The sons of Uzziel: Mishael, Elzaphan, and Sithri.
Aroni a a tekile Elixeba N'wa-Aminadaba makwavo wa Nahaxoni; kutani Elixeba a veleka, Nadabu, na Abihu, na Eliyazara, na Itamara.	Aaron took as his wife Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab and the sister of Nahshon, and she bore him Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
Vana va Kora hi lava: Asiri, na Elkana, na Abiyasafa; hi vona va yindlu ya ka Kora.	The sons of Korah: Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph; these are the clans of the Korahites.
Eliyazara n'wana Aroni a a tekile un'wana wa vana va Putiele, kutani wansati loyi a veleka Finiyasi.
Lowu hi wona nongoloko wa nyimba ya ka Levhi, hi ku tlhandlamana ka tindlu ta ka vona.	Eleazar, Aaron's son, took as his wife one of the daughters of Putiel, and she bore him Phinehas. These are the heads of the fathers' houses of the Levites by their clans.
Aroni na Muxe, hi vona lava Xikwembu xi nga va byela xi ku: Humesani vanhu va Israele etikweni ra Egipta, hi mintshungu ya vona.	These are the Aaron and Moses to whom the LORD said: Bring out the people of Israel from the land of Egypt by their hosts.
Muxe loyi na Aroni loyi, hi vona lava nga ya byela Faro leswaku a tshika Vaisraele va huma etikweni ra Egipta.	It was they who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt about bringing out the people of Israel from Egypt, this Moses and this Aaron.
Siku leri HOSI Xikwembu xi vulavuleke na Muxe etikweni ra Egipta	On the day when the LORD spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt
xi te ka yena: Hi mina HOSI Xikwembu; u ta byela Faro hosi ya Egipta hinkwaswo leswi ndzi ku lerisaka swona.	the LORD said to Moses, I am the LORD; tell Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say to you.
Kambe Muxe a hlamula a ku: Vona, ndzi ni manghanghamila; xana Faro ú ta ndzi twa ke?	But Moses said to the LORD, Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips. How will Pharaoh listen to me?
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe: Languta, ndzi ta endla leswaku Faro a ku teka onge u Xikwembu, kutani makwenu Aroni ú ta va nomo wa wena.	And the LORD said to Moses, See, I have made you like God to Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron shall be your prophet.
Wena u ta vula hinkwaswo leswi ndzi nga ta ku lerisa swona, kutani makwenu Aroni yena ú ta byela Faro leswaku a tshika Vaisraele va huma etikweni ra yena.	You shall speak all that I command you, and your brother Aaron shall tell Pharaoh to let the people of Israel go out of his land.
Kambe mina ndzi ta nonon'hwisa mbilu ya Faro, lero hambiloko ndzi andzisa swikombiso ni swihlamariso etikweni ra Egipta	But I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and though I multiply my signs and wonders in the land of Egypt
Faro a nga ka a nga mi yingisi; kwalaho ndzi ta tirhisa matimba ya mina ehenhla ka tiko ra Egipta, ndzi humesa mintshungu ya mina, va nga vanhu va mina va Israele, etikweni ra Egipta, hi ku avanyisa loku hlamarisaka.	Pharaoh will not listen to you. Then I will lay my hand on Egypt and bring my hosts, my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great acts of judgment.
Loko ndzi tirhisile matimba ya mina ehenhla ka tiko ra Egipta ku humesa vanhu va mina exikarhi ka rona, hi kona Vaegipta va nga ta tiva leswaku hi mina HOSI Xikwembu.	The Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch out my hand against Egypt and bring out the people of Israel from among them.
Kutani Muxe na Aroni va endla hilaha HOSI Xikwembu xi va leriseke hakona.	Moses and Aaron did so; they did just as the LORD commanded them.
Enkarhini lowu va nga ya vulavula na Faro, Muxe a a ri ni malembe ya 80, Aroni yena a a ri ni malembe ya 83.	Now Moses was eighty years old, and Aaron eighty-three years old, when they spoke to Pharaoh.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe na Aroni	Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron
Loko Faro a mi byela leswaku mi tikombisa hi ku endla swihlamariso, wena Muxe u ta lerisa Aroni leswaku a teka nhonga ya yena a yi hoxa hansi emahlweni ka Faro, kutani yi ta hundzuka nyoka.	When Pharaoh says to you, 'Prove yourselves by working a miracle,' then you shall say to Aaron, 'Take your staff and cast it down before Pharaoh, that it may become a serpent.'
Kutani Muxe na Aroni va ya eka Faro, va endla hilaha HOSI Xikwembu xi va leriseke hakona: Aroni a hoxa nhonga ya yena emahlweni ka Faro ni malandza ya yena, kutani nhonga yi hundzuka nyoka.	So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did just as the LORD commanded. Aaron cast down his staff before Pharaoh and his servants, and it became a serpent.
Kwalaho Faro a vitana tintlhari ni vangoma va tiko, kutani vaendli lava va mahlori va tiko ra Egipta na vona va endla swo fana ni swa Aroni, hi migilo-gilo ya vona.	Then Pharaoh summoned the wise men and the sorcerers, and they, the magicians of Egypt, also did the same by their secret arts.
Un'wana ni un'wana wa vona a hoxa nhonga ya yena ehansi, kutani yi hundzuka nyoka, kambe nhonga ya Aroni yi mitetela ta vona.	For each man cast down his staff, and they became serpents. But Aaron's staff swallowed up their staffs.
Hambiswiritano, Faro a tinonon'hwisa, a nga yingisi Muxe na Aroni, hilaha HOSI Xikwembu a xi vurile hakona.	Still Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he would not listen to them, as the LORD had said.
Hiloko HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe: Faro wa tinonon'hwisa, ú ala ku tshika vanhu va famba.	Then the LORD said to Moses, Pharaoh's heart is hardened; he refuses to let the people go.
Kutani yana eka Faro nimpundzu, nkarhi lowu a humaka a ya enambyeni, u famba u khomile nhonga leyi a yi hundzukile nyoka, u fika u n'wi yimela eribuweni ra nambu.	Go to Pharaoh in the morning, as he is going out to the water. Stand on the bank of the Nile to meet him, and take in your hand the staff that turned into a serpent.
U ta ku ka yena: ‘HOSI Xikwembu, xi nga Xikwembu xa Vaheveru, xi ndzi rhumile eka wena leswaku u tshika vanhu va xona va ya xi gandzela emananga, kambe wena ku fika ni sweswi a wu si yingisa.	And you shall say to him, 'The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, sent me to you, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness. But so far, you have not obeyed.
Hikokwalaho HOSI Xikwembu xi vurisa sweswo xi ri, hi xona xi nga HOSI! U ta swi tiva hi mukhuva lowu: Mina Muxe ndzi ta ba mati ya nambu hi nhonga leyi ndzi nga yi khoma, kutani ma ta hundzuka ngati.	Thus says the LORD, By this you shall know that I am the LORD: behold, with the staff that is in my hand I will strike the water that is in the Nile, and it shall turn into blood.
Tinhlampfi ti ta fa enambyeni; nambu wa kona wu ta nun'hwa, kutani vanhu va Egipta va ta tsandzeka ku nwa mati ya wona.’ 	The fish in the Nile shall die, and the Nile will stink, and the Egyptians will grow weary of drinking water from the Nile.'
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe: Lerisa Aroni leswaku a teka nhonga ya yena hi voko, a yi tlakusela ehenhla ka mati hinkwawo ya le Egipta, emilambyeni, ni le tindleleni ta mati, ni le maqhivini, ni le mativeni hinkwawo, kutani mati ya kona ma ta hundzuka ngati. Tiko hinkwaro ra Egipta ri ta tala hi ngati, yi ta va kona ni le swibyeni swo vatliwa ni le makhuwaneni.	And the LORD said to Moses, Say to Aaron, 'Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt, over their rivers, their canals, and their ponds, and all their pools of water, so that they may become blood, and there shall be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, even in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone.'
Kutani Muxe na Aroni va endla hilaha HOSI Xikwembu xi leriseke hakona: Aroni a tlakusa nhonga emahlweni ka Faro ni malandza ya yena, a ba mati ya nambu, kutani hinkwawo ma hundzuka ngati.	Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded. In the sight of Pharaoh and in the sight of his servants he lifted up the staff and struck the water in the Nile, and all the water in the Nile turned into blood.
Tinhlampfi ta nambu ti fa, nambu wu sungula ku nun'hwa, kutani vanhu va Egipta va tsandzeka ku nwa mati ya kona; tiko ra Egipta hinkwaro ri tala hi ngati.	And the fish in the Nile died, and the Nile stank, so that the Egyptians could not drink water from the Nile. There was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.
Kambe vangoma va tiko ra Egipta na vona va endlisa sweswo hi migilo-gilo ya vona; hikokwalaho Faro a ya emahlweni a tinonon'hwisa, a nga yingisi Muxe na Aroni, tani hilaha HOSI Xikwembu a xi vurile hakona.	But the magicians of Egypt did the same by their secret arts. So Pharaoh's heart remained hardened, and he would not listen to them, as the LORD had said.
Kutani Faro a tlhelela entsindza; leswi humeleleke a swi nga n'wi khumbanga nikutsongo.	Pharaoh turned and went into his house, and he did not take even this to heart.
Vanhu hinkwavo va tiko ra Egipta va famba va cela swihlovo eribuweni ra nambu, va lava mati yo nwa, hikuva a va nga ha koti ku nwa lawa yo huma enambyeni wa Nilo.	And all the Egyptians dug along the Nile for water to drink, for they could not drink the water of the Nile.
Swi tekile masiku ya 7, ku sukela loko HOSI Xikwembu xi bile mati ya nambu.	Seven full days passed after the LORD had struck the Nile.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe: Famba eka Faro, u ya n'wi byela leswaku mina HOSI Xikwembu ndzi vurisa sweswo, ndzi ri: ‘Tshika vanhu va mina va famba va ya ndzi gandzela.	Then the LORD said to Moses, Go in to Pharaoh and say to him, 'Thus says the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
Loko u ala ku va tshika va famba, ndzi ta ba tiko ra wena matlhelo hinkwawo hi khombo ra mintlambya.	But if you refuse to let them go, behold, I will plague all your country with frogs.
Nambu wu ta tala hi mintlambya, yi kondza yi huma yi ta emutini wa wena, ni le ndlwini ya wena, ni le masangwini ya wena, ni le tindlwini ta malandza ya wena, ni le ka vanhu va tiko ra wena, ni le swibyeni swa le xitangeni.	The Nile shall swarm with frogs that shall come up into your house and into your bedroom and on your bed and into the houses of your servants and your people, and into your ovens and your kneading bowls.
Mintlambya yi ta tlula yi tshama ehenhla ka wena, ni le henhla ka vanhu va wena, ni le henhla ka malandza ya wena hinkwawo.’ 	The frogs shall come up on you and on your people and on all your servants.'
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe: Lerisa Aroni leswaku a teka nhonga ya yena hi voko, a yi tlakusela ehenhla ka milambu, ni le henhla ka tindlela ta mati, ni le henhla ka maqhivi, a vangela tiko ra Egipta khombo ra mintlambya.	And the LORD said to Moses, Say to Aaron, 'Stretch out your hand with your staff over the rivers, over the canals and over the pools, and make frogs come up on the land of Egypt!'
Hiloko Aroni a tlakusela voko ra yena ehenhla ka mati ya Egipta, kutani mintlambya yi huma yi tata tiko hinkwaro.	So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt.
Kambe vangoma na vona va endlisa sweswo hi migilo-gilo ya vona, va vanga mintlambya etikweni ra Egipta.	But the magicians did the same by their secret arts and made frogs come up on the land of Egypt.
Kutani Faro a vitana Muxe na Aroni, a ku ka vona: Khongelani mi kombela HOSI Xikwembu leswaku xi susa mintlambya laha ka mina, ni le ka vanhu va mina; hi kona ndzi nga ta tshika vanhu, va famba va ya humesela HOSI Xikwembu emagandzelo.	Then Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron and said, Plead with the LORD to take away the frogs from me and from my people, and I will let the people go to sacrifice to the LORD.
Muxe a hlamula a ku: Swi le ka wena ku lerisa nkarhi lowu ndzi nga ta khongela ha wona, ndzi mi kombelela, wena ni malandza ya wena ni vanhu va wena, leswaku mintlambya yi susiwa eka wena, ni le tindlwini ta wena, yi sala enambyeni ntsena.	Moses said to Pharaoh, Be pleased to command me when I am to plead for you and for your servants and for your people, that the frogs be cut off from you and your houses and be left only in the Nile.
Kutani Faro a ku: Mundzuku! Muxe a ku: Swi ta va hilaha u vulaka hakona, u ta tiva leswaku ku hava loyi a fanaka na HOSI Xikwembu xa hina.	And he said, Tomorrow. Moses said, Be it as you say, so that you may know that there is no one like the LORD our God.
Mintlambya yi ta suka eka wena ni le tindlwini ta wena ni le ka malandza ya wena ni ka vanhu va wena; yi ta sala enambyeni ntsena.	The frogs shall go away from you and your houses and your servants and your people. They shall be left only in the Nile.
Hiloko Muxe na Aroni va suka va huma eka Faro; Muxe a huwelela eka HOSI Xikwembu hi tlhelo ra mintlambya leyi xi yi vangeleke Faro.	So Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh, and Moses cried to the LORD about the frogs, as he had agreed with Pharaoh.
HOSI Xikwembu xi endla hilaha Muxe a kombeleke hakona: Mintlambya yi fa etindlwini, ni le swivaveni, ni le masin'wini	And the LORD did according to the word of Moses. The frogs died out in the houses, the courtyards, and the fields.
kutani Vaegipta va yi hlengeleta hi tinhulu, tiko hinkwaro ri nun'hwa hi yona.	And they gathered them together in heaps, and the land stank.
Kambe loko Faro a kuma nkarhi wo hefemula, a tlhela a tinonon'hwisa, a nga yingisi Muxe na Aroni, hilaha HOSI Xikwembu a xi vurile hakona.	But when Pharaoh saw that there was a respite, he hardened his heart and would not listen to them, as the LORD had said.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe: Lerisa Aroni leswaku a tlakusa nhonga ya yena, a ba hansi leswaku ritshuri ri hundzuka tinhwala etikweni hinkwaro ra Egipta.	Then the LORD said to Moses, Say to Aaron, 'Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the earth, so that it may become gnats in all the land of Egypt.'
Kutani va endlisa sweswo: Aroni a tlakusa voko, a ba hansi hi nhonga, kutani ku huma tinhwala, ti pomela vanhu ni swifuwo swa vona, ritshuri hinkwaro ri hundzuka tinhwala, ematlhelweni hinkwawo ya tiko ra Egipta.	And they did so. Aaron stretched out his hand with his staff and struck the dust of the earth, and there were gnats on man and beast. All the dust of the earth became gnats in all the land of Egypt.
Kwalaho vangoma va ringeta ku vanga tinhwala hi migilo-gilo ya vona, kambe va tsandzeka. Tinhwala a ti tele ehenhla ka vanhu ni swifuwo.	The magicians tried by their secret arts to produce gnats, but they could not. So there were gnats on man and beast.
Kutani vangoma va ku ka Faro: Lowu i ntirho wa Xikwembu! Kambe Faro a tinonon'hwisa, a nga yingisi Muxe na Aroni, hilaha HOSI Xikwembu a xi vurile hakona.	Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, This is the finger of God. But Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he would not listen to them, as the LORD had said.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe: Pfuka nimpundzu swinene, u ya sivelela Faro loko a huma a ya enambyeni, u n'wi byela leswaku mina HOSI Xikwembu ndzi vurisa sweswo, ndzi ri: ‘Tshika vanhu va mina va famba va ya ndzi humesela magandzelo.	Then the LORD said to Moses, Rise up early in the morning and present yourself to Pharaoh, as he goes out to the water, and say to him, 'Thus says the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
Loko u nga lavi ku tshika vanhu va mina va famba, u ta swi vona! Ndzi ta ku rhumela mabawa, wena ni malandza ya wena ni vanhu va wena, ma nghena ni le tindlwini ta wena; mabawa ma ta tala etindlwini ta vanhu va Egipta, ma funengeta ni misava leyi va akeke ka yona.	Or else, if you will not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies on you and your servants and your people, and into your houses. And the houses of the Egyptians shall be filled with swarms of flies, and also the ground on which they stand.
Kambe hi siku ra kona, ndzi ta hlawula muganga wa le Goxeni, laha vanhu va mina va tshamaka kona; a ku nga vi na mabawa kona, u ta kala u swi tiva wena Faro leswaku hi mina ndzi nga HOSI laha misaveni.	But on that day I will set apart the land of Goshen, where my people dwell, so that no swarms of flies shall be there, that you may know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth.
Hikokwalaho, ndzi ta kutsula vanhu va mina ndzi va hambanisa ni vanhu va wena. Xikombiso lexi xi ta humelela mundzuku.’ 	Thus I will put a division between my people and your people. Tomorrow this sign shall happen.'
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi endlisa sweswo: Xi rhumela papa lerikulu ra mabawa emutini wa Faro ni le mitini ya malandza ya yena, tiko hinkwaro ra Egipta ri xanisiwa hi mabawa lawa.	And the LORD did so. There came great swarms of flies into the house of Pharaoh and into his servants' houses. Throughout all the land of Egypt the land was ruined by the swarms of flies.
Kutani Faro a vitana Muxe na Aroni, a ku ka vona: Fambani mi ya humesela Xikwembu xa n'wina emagandzelo, kambe mi ri kwala tikweni leri.	Then Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron and said, Go, sacrifice to your God within the land.
Muxe a hlamula a ku: E-e, sweswo swi ta va swi hoxekile, hikuva hi ta humesela HOSI Xikwembu xa hina emagandzelo lama nga tshukaka ma khunguvanyisa Vaegipta. Loko hi tshuka hi humesa magandzelo lama yilaka emahlweni ka Vaegipta, xana a va nga hi khandli hi maribye va hi dlaya ke?	But Moses said, It would not be right to do so, for the offerings we shall sacrifice to the LORD our God are an abomination to the Egyptians. If we sacrifice offerings abominable to the Egyptians before their eyes, will they not stone us?
Hina hi fanele ku teka riendzo ra masiku manharhu, hi ya emananga hi ya humesela HOSI Xikwembu xa hina emagandzelo lawa xi nga ta hi lerisa wona.	We must go three days' journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to the LORD our God as he tells us.
Kutani Faro a hlamula a ku: Ndzi ta mi tshika mi famba mi ya humesela HOSI Xikwembu xa n'wina emagandzelo emananga, ntsena mi nga yi kule ngopfu. Ndzi khongeleleni!	So Pharaoh said, I will let you go to sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only you must not go very far away. Plead for me.
Kutani Muxe a ku: Vona, sweswi ndzi humaka laha ka wena, ndzi ta khongela HOSI Xikwembu leswaku mundzuku mabawa ma suka laha ka wena Faro, ma suka ni le ka malandza ya wena ni le ka vanhu va wena; ntsena u nga ha engeti u tlanga hi hina, hi ku sivela vanhu va hina ku ya humesela HOSI Xikwembu emagandzelo.	Then Moses said, Behold, I am going out from you and I will plead with the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, tomorrow. Only let not Pharaoh cheat again by not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD.
Kavaloko Muxe a huma eka Faro, a ya khongela HOSI Xikwembu.	So Moses went out from Pharaoh and prayed to the LORD.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi endla hilaha Muxe a kombeleke hakona: Xi susa mabawa eka Faro, ni le ka malandza ya yena, ni le ka vanhu va yena, ku nga sali na rin'we ra wona.	And the LORD did as Moses asked, and removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; not one remained.
Kambe Faro a tlhela a tinonon'hwisa, a nga va tshiki vanhu leswaku va famba.	But Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and did not let the people go.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe: Yana u ya nghena emutini wa Faro, u ya n'wi byela leswaku mina HOSI Xikwembu xa Vaheveru ndzi vurisa sweswo, ndzi ri: ‘Tshika vanhu va mina va famba va ya ndzi gandzela.	Then the LORD said to Moses, Go in to Pharaoh and say to him, 'Thus says the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
Loko u nga va tshiki va famba, u ala u va khomeleta	For if you refuse to let them go and still hold them
mina HOSI Xikwembu ndzi ta ba swifuwo swa wena leswi nga madyelweni, hi xirha lexo chavisa swinene lexi nga ta wela tihanci, ni timbhongolo, ni tikamela, ni tihomu, ni tinyimpfu ni timbuti.	behold, the hand of the LORD will fall with a very severe plague upon your livestock that are in the field, the horses, the donkeys, the camels, the herds, and the flocks.
Kambe mina HOSI Xikwembu ndzi ta hlawula swifuwo swa Vaisraele eka swifuwo swa Vaegipta, leswaku ku nga tshuki ku fa ni xin'we xa leswi swi nga swa Vaisraele.’ 	But the LORD will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt, so that nothing of all that belongs to the people of Israel shall die.'
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi veka nkarhi xi ku: Swilo leswi ndzi ta swi endla mundzuku laha tikweni, mina HOSI.	And the LORD set a time, saying, Tomorrow the LORD will do this thing in the land.
Kunene hi siku leri tlhandlamaka, HOSI Xikwembu xi endla mhaka leyi: Swifuwo swa Vaegipta swi fa hinkwaswo, kambe eka swifuwo swa Vaisraele a ku fanga ni xin'we.	And the next day the LORD did this thing. All the livestock of the Egyptians died, but not one of the livestock of the people of Israel died.
Loko Faro a vutisisa, a twa leswaku ni xin'we xa swifuwo swa Vaisraele a xi fanga; kambe hambiswiritano, a ya emahlweni a tinonon'hwisa, a nga tshiki vanhu leswaku va famba.	And Pharaoh sent, and behold, not one of the livestock of Israel was dead. But the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe na Aroni: Nusani nkuma exitikweni, kutani Muxe ú ta wu haxa ehenhla, emahlweni ka Faro.	And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, Take handfuls of soot from the kiln, and let Moses throw them in the air in the sight of Pharaoh.
Kutani wu ta hundzuka ritshuri etikweni hinkwaro ra Egipta, wu vanga matshumba lama nga ta baleka, ma endla swilondza eka vanhu ni swifuwo, ematlhelweni hinkwawo ya tiko.	It shall become fine dust over all the land of Egypt, and become boils breaking out in sores on man and beast throughout all the land of Egypt.
Kwalaho va nusa nkuma exitikweni, va ya yima emahlweni ka Faro, kutani Muxe a wu haxa ehenhla. Kavaloko nkuma wu vanga matshumba, ma endla swilondza eka vanhu ni swifuwo.	So they took soot from the kiln and stood before Pharaoh. And Moses threw it in the air, and it became boils breaking out in sores on man and beast.
Vangoma a va swi kotanga ku ya humelela emahlweni ka Muxe na Aroni, hikuva a va tele matshumba, ku fana ni Vaegipta van'wana hinkwavo.	And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils, for the boils came upon the magicians and upon all the Egyptians.
Kambe HOSI Xikwembu xi nonon'hwisa mbilu ya Faro, a nga yingisi Muxe na Aroni, tanihilaha a xi byerile Muxe hakona.	But the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he did not listen to them, as the LORD had spoken to Moses.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe: Pfuka nimpundzu swinene, u ya sivelela Faro, u n'wi byela leswaku mina HOSI Xikwembu xa Vaheveru ndzi vurisa sweswo ndzi ri: ‘Tshika vanhu va mina va famba va ya ndzi gandzela.	Then the LORD said to Moses, Rise up early in the morning and present yourself before Pharaoh and say to him, 'Thus says the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
Makhombo hinkwawo lawa ndzi nga ta ma rhumela sweswi, ndzi ta ma rhumela eka wena, ni le ka malandza ya wena, ni le ka vanhu va wena, u ta tiva leswaku emisaveni hinkwayo a nga kona la fanaka na mina.	For this time I will send all my plagues on you yourself, and on your servants and your people, so that you may know that there is none like me in all the earth.
Loko a ndzi swi lavile, ingi ndzi tirhisile matimba ya mina khale ndzi ku ba hi ntungu, wena ni vanhu va wena, kutani sweswi a mi ta va mi herisiwile laha misaveni.	For by now I could have put out my hand and struck you and your people with pestilence, and you would have been cut off from the earth.
Kambe ndzi ku tshikile u hanya, xikongomelo xa kona ku ri ku ku komba matimba ya mina, leswaku vito ra mina ri ta twarisiwa emisaveni hinkwayo.	But for this purpose I have raised you up, to show you my power, so that my name may be proclaimed in all the earth.
Na sweswi, wa ha ya emahlweni u tikurisa, hi ku ala ku tshika vanhu va mina va famba.	You are still exalting yourself against my people and will not let them go.
Hikokwalaho mundzuku kwalomu ka minkarhi yoleyi, ndzi ta vanga xihangu lexikulu, lexi ku sukela loko tiko ra Egipta ri tumbuluka ku fikela namuntlha xi nga si tshamaka xi va kona.	Behold, about this time tomorrow I will cause very heavy hail to fall, such as never has been in Egypt from the day it was founded until now.
Kutani sweswi, lerisa leswaku swifuwo swa wena ni swilo swa wena hinkwaswo leswi nga enhoveni swi hlayisiwa endhawini leyi sirheleriweke, hikuva hinkwaswo leswi nga ta ka swi nga vuyisiwanga ekaya, hambi vanhu kumbe swifuwo, swi ta weriwa hi xihangu swi fa.’ 	Now therefore send, get your livestock and all that you have in the field into safe shelter, for every man and beast that is in the field and is not brought home will die when the hail falls on them.'
A ku ri ni van'wana exikarhi ka malandza ya Faro lava tshukisiweke hi rito ra HOSI Xikwembu, kutani va hatlisa va nghenisa mahlonga ya vona ni swifuwo swa vona etindlwini.	Then whoever feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh hurried his slaves and his livestock into the houses
Kambe lava a va nga ri na mhaka ni rito ra HOSI Xikwembu, va tshika mahlonga ya vona ni swifuwo swa vona enhoveni.	but whoever did not pay attention to the word of the LORD left his slaves and his livestock in the field.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe: Tlakusela voko ra wena ehenhla, leswaku ku ta wa xihangu etikweni hinkwaro ra Egipta; xi ta wela vanhu, ni swifuwo, ni swimilana emasin'wini, ematlhelweni hinkwawo ya tiko ra Egipta.	Then the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out your hand toward heaven, so that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, on man and beast and every plant of the field, in the land of Egypt.
Kutani Muxe a tlakusa nhonga ya yena a komba ehenhla, kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi pfumisa tilo, xi rhumela ni xihangu, rihati ri ba ri nghena ehansi. HOSI Xikwembu xi wisa xihangu etikweni ra Egipta	Then Moses stretched out his staff toward heaven, and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and fire ran down to the earth. And the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt.
kutani xi wa xi pfangene ni rihati. Xihangu xa kona a xi chavisa swinene; hi mpfhuka xa loko vanhu va akile etikweni ra Egipta, xihangu xo tano a xi nga si tshama xi va kona.	There was hail and fire flashing continually in the midst of the hail, very heavy hail, such as had never been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.
Hinkwaswo leswi a swi ri erivaleni etikweni ra Egipta, hambi vanhu kumbe swifuwo, swi biwa hi xihangu swi fa; xihangu xi dlayetela ni swimilana hinkwaswo emasin'wini, xi tshovelela ni mirhi hinkwayo enhoveni.	The hail struck down everything that was in the field in all the land of Egypt, both man and beast. And the hail struck down every plant of the field and broke every tree of the field.
Muganga lowu xihangu xi nga wangiki eka wona, a wu ri wa le Goxeni ntsena, laha Vaisraele a va tshama kona.	Only in the land of Goshen, where the people of Israel were, was there no hail.
Faro a rhuma vanhu, va ya vitana Muxe na Aroni, kutani a ku ka vona: Sweswi ndza pfumela leswaku ndzi dyohile. HOSI Xikwembu a xi na nandzu, nandzu wu na mina ni vanhu va mina.	Then Pharaoh sent and called Moses and Aaron and said to them, This time I have sinned; the LORD is in the right, and I and my people are in the wrong.
Hi khongeleleni eka HOSI Xikwembu, hikuva tilo leri ni xihangu lexi swi hi karhatile ku ringana; ndzi ta mi tshika mi famba, a mi nga ha kali mi tshama.	Plead with the LORD, for there has been enough of God's thunder and hail. I will let you go, and you shall stay no longer.
Muxe a ku ka yena: Sweswi ndzi nga ta huma laha ka wena, ndzi ta tlakusa mavoko ya mina ndzi khongela HOSI Xikwembu; tilo ri ta yima, naswona a ku nga ha vi na xihangu, kutani hi kona u nga ta tiva leswaku misava i ya HOSI Xikwembu.	Moses said to him, As soon as I have gone out of the city, I will stretch out my hands to the LORD. The thunder will cease, and there will be no more hail, so that you may know that the earth is the LORD's.
Kambe ndza swi tiva leswaku wena ni malandza ya wena, ni sweswi a mi si va ni xichavo eka HOSI Xikwembu.	But as for you and your servants, I know that you do not yet fear the LORD God.
(Swimila swa ntsembyani ni swa maxalana swi herisiwile hi xihangu, hikuva maxalana a ma ri karhi ma vupfa, ntsembyani wona a wa ha ku baleka swiluva.	(The flax and the barley were struck down, for the barley was in the ear and the flax was in bud.
Kambe swimilana swa tikoroni a swi herisiwanga, hikuva swona swa hlwela ku rhumbuka.)	But the wheat and the emmer were not struck down, for they are late in coming up.)
Kutani Muxe a suka eka Faro, a huma emutini, a tlakusa mavoko ya yena a khongela HOSI Xikwembu; kutani tilo ni xihangu swi yima, na yona mpfula yi hangalaka.	So Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh and stretched out his hands to the LORD, and the thunder and the hail ceased, and the rain no longer poured upon the earth.
Loko Faro a vona leswaku mpfula ni xihangu ni tilo swi yimile, a engeta a dyoha, a tinonon'hwisa, yena ni malandza ya yena.	But when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunder had ceased, he sinned yet again and hardened his heart, he and his servants.
Kutani Faro a tinonon'hwisisa sweswo, a nga tshiki vanhu va Israele leswaku va famba, tanihilaha HOSI Xikwembu a xi vurile hakona, hi nomo wa Muxe.	So the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people of Israel go, just as the LORD had spoken through Moses.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe: Yana u ya nghena emutini wa Faro. Ndzi nonon'hwisile mbilu ya yena ni timbilu ta malandza ya yena, leswaku ndzi ta humesa swikombiso swa mina exikarhi ka vona	Then the LORD said to Moses, Go in to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart and the heart of his servants, that I may show these signs of mine among them
kutani wena u ta rungulela vana va wena ni vatukulu va wena hilaha ndzi tlangeke hi Vaegipta hakona; u ta va hlayela ni swikombiso leswi ndzi swi humeseke exikarhi ka Vaegipta, kutani mi ta tiva leswaku hi mina HOSI Xikwembu.	and that you may tell in the hearing of your son and of your grandson how I have dealt harshly with the Egyptians and what signs I have done among them, that you may know that I am the LORD.
Kavaloko Muxe na Aroni va ya nghena emutini wa Faro, va fika va ku: HOSI Xikwembu, xi nga Xikwembu xa Vaheveru, xi vurisa sweswo xi ku: ‘Xana u ta ala ku titsongahata emahlweni ka mina ku fikela rini ke? Tshika vanhu va mina va famba, va ya ndzi gandzela.	So Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh and said to him, Thus says the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, 'How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me? Let my people go, that they may serve me.
Loko u ala ku tshika vanhu va mina va famba, tiva leswaku mundzuku ndzi ta tisa tinjiya ematlhelweni hinkwawo ya tiko ra wena.	For if you refuse to let my people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your country
Tinjiya leti ti ta funengeta hinkwako laha hansi, ku sala ku nga ha vonaki; ti ta dya swilo swa n'wina leswi poneke xihangu, ti dya ni mirhi ya n'wina hinkwayo leyi hlukeke enhoveni.	and they shall cover the face of the land, so that no one can see the land. And they shall eat what is left to you after the hail, and they shall eat every tree of yours that grows in the field
Tindlu ta wena, ni ta malandza ya wena, ni ta vanhu hinkwavo va Egipta, ti ta tala hi tinjiya leti hambi va ri vatata wa wena ni vakokwa wa wena va nga si ti vonaka, hi mpfhuka va velekiwa ku fikela namuntlha!’  Kutani Muxe a hundzuluka, a huma eka Faro.	and they shall fill your houses and the houses of all your servants and of all the Egyptians, as neither your fathers nor your grandfathers have seen, from the day they came on earth to this day.' Then he turned and went out from Pharaoh.
Hiloko malandza ya Faro ma ku ka yena: Xana wanuna loyi ú ta hi vangela makhombo ku fikela rini xana? Pfumela leswaku ku famba vavanuna, va ya gandzela HOSI Xikwembu xa vona. Xana ni sweswi a wu si swi vona leswaku tiko ra Egipta ra lova, xana?	Then Pharaoh's servants said to him, How long shall this man be a snare to us? Let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God. Do you not yet understand that Egypt is ruined?
Kavaloko Muxe na Aroni va tlhela va vitaniwa eka Faro, kutani a ku ka vona: Mi nga ya mi ya humesela HOSI Xikwembu emagandzelo; kambe i vamani lava faneleke ku famba xana?	So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh. And he said to them, Go, serve the LORD your God. But which ones are to go?
Muxe a hlamula a ku: Hi fanele ku famba hinkwerhu, hambi va ri lavatsongo kumbe lavakulu. Hambi va ri vana va hina va majaha kumbe vanhwana, hi ta famba na vona; na tona timbuti ni tinyimpfu ni tihomu ta hina, a ti nga sali, hikuva hi ta va ni nkhuvo wo tlangela HOSI Xikwembu.	Moses said, We will go with our young and our old. We will go with our sons and daughters and with our flocks and herds, for we must hold a feast to the LORD.
Kutani Faro a ku ka vona: Loko ndzo mi tshika mi famba ni mindyangu ya n'wina, swi ta vula leswaku HOSI Xikwembu xi na n'wina! Swa vonaka leswaku mi le ku lukeni ka makungu layo biha.	But he said to them, The LORD be with you, if ever I let you and your little ones go! Look, you have some evil purpose in mind.
E-e, loko ku ri leswaku mi tsakela ku ya humesela HOSI Xikwembu emagandzelo, a ku fambe vavanuna ntsena! Kwalaho, Muxe na Aroni va hlongoriwa, va suka emahlweni ka Faro.	No! Go, the men among you, and serve the LORD, for that is what you are asking. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe: Tlakusela voko ra wena ehenhla ka tiko ra Egipta, leswaku tinjiya ti ta haha ti nghena etikweni, ti herisa swimilana hinkwaswo leswi poneke xihangu, ematlhelweni hinkwawo ya tiko.	Then the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, so that they may come upon the land of Egypt and eat every plant in the land, all that the hail has left.
Hiloko Muxe a tlakusela nhonga ya yena ehenhla ka tiko ra Egipta; kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi hungisa moya wo huma evuxeni; wu hunga siku ra kona hinkwaro ni vusiku hinkwabyo. Loko ri xa, moya lowu a wu nghenisile tinjiya.	So Moses stretched out his staff over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day and all that night. When it was morning, the east wind had brought the locusts.
Kutani tinjiya ti haha ti nghena etikweni ra Egipta, ti phatsama ematlhelweni hinkwawo ya rona. Tinjiya to tarisa sweswo a ti nga si tshama ti voniwa, naswona ti nga ka ti nga ha voniwi	The locusts came up over all the land of Egypt and settled on the whole country of Egypt, such a dense swarm of locusts as had never been before, nor ever will be again.
ti funengeta hinkwako laha hansi, ku sala ku lo tshwukelana hi tona. Ti dyetetela swimilana hinkwaswo etikweni, ti dya ni mihandzu hinkwayo ya mirhi leyi poneke xihangu; a ti siyanga ni xilo ni xin'we xa rihlaza ematlhelweni hinkwawo ya tiko ra Egipta, ti dya hambi yi ri mirhi kumbe swimila-milani emasin'wini.	They covered the face of the whole land, so that the land was darkened, and they ate all the plants in the land and all the fruit of the trees that the hail had left. Not a green thing remained, neither tree nor plant of the field, through all the land of Egypt.
Kutani Faro a hatla a vitana Muxe na Aroni, a ku ka vona: Ndzi dyohele HOSI Xikwembu xa n'wina, ndzi dyohele na n'wina.	Then Pharaoh hastily called Moses and Aaron and said, I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.
Hikokwalaho, ndzi kombela leswaku mi ndzi rivalela swidyoho swa mina, kan'we ntsena; naswona ndzi khongeleleni eka HOSI Xikwembu xa n'wina, leswaku xi bakanyela kule na mina khombo leri ra tinjiya.	Now therefore, forgive my sin, please, only this once, and plead with the LORD your God only to remove this death from me.
Kutani Muxe a huma eka Faro, a ya khongela HOSI Xikwembu.	So he went out from Pharaoh and pleaded with the LORD.
Hiloko HOSI Xikwembu xi tlherisa moya, xi wu hungisa wu huma evupeladyambu, wu vunga tinjiya wu ya ti chela eka Lwandle-ro-Tshwuka; ematlhelweni hinkwawo ya tiko ra Egipta, a ku salanga ni njiya ni yin'we.	And the LORD turned the wind into a very strong west wind, which lifted the locusts and drove them into the Red Sea. Not a single locust was left in all the country of Egypt.
Kambe HOSI Xikwembu xi nonon'hwisa mbilu ya Faro, a nga tshiki vanhu va Israele va famba.	But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not let the people of Israel go.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe: Tlakusela voko ra wena ehenhla, u vanga xinyami etikweni ra Egipta, lexi nga ta endla leswaku vanhu va gugurhuteka kunene.	Then the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out your hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, a darkness to be felt.
Hiloko Muxe a tlakusela voko ra yena ehenhla, kutani ku va ni xinyami lexo chavisa masiku manharhu, etikweni hinkwaro ra Egipta.	So Moses stretched out his hand toward heaven, and there was pitch darkness in all the land of Egypt three days.
Masiku manharhu lawa, vanhu va Egipta a va nga ha koti ni ku vonana; ni ku huma etindlwini a va nga ha humi; kambe hinkwako laha vanhu va Israele a va tshama kona a ku ri ni ku vonakala.	They did not see one another, nor did anyone rise from his place for three days, but all the people of Israel had light where they lived.
Kutani Faro a vitana Muxe na Aroni, a ku ka vona: Yanani mi ya humesela HOSI Xikwembu emagandzelo; mindyangu ya n'wina yi nga famba na n'wina, kambe timbuti ni tinyimpfu ni tihomu ta n'wina, tona ta sala!	Then Pharaoh called Moses and said, Go, serve the LORD; your little ones also may go with you; only let your flocks and your herds remain behind.
Kambe Muxe a hlamula a ku: Xana u ta hi nyika swo humesa magandzelo lama dyiwaka ni lama hisiwaka, hi gandzela HOSI Xikwembu ha swona, xana?	But Moses said, You must also let us have sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.
Swifuwo swa hina, hi fanele ku famba na swona; a ku nga sali ni xinyondzwana xa swona ni xin'we, hikuva hi ta pambula swifuwo swin'wana exikarhi ka swona, hi tlhavela HOSI Xikwembu xa hina; naswona a hi si tiva leswaku hi ta xi humesela yini, swi ta tiveka ntsena loko hi fikile kwale.	Our livestock also must go with us; not a hoof shall be left behind, for we must take of them to serve the LORD our God, and we do not know with what we must serve the LORD until we arrive there.
Hambiswiritano, HOSI Xikwembu xi nonon'hwisa mbilu ya Faro, a ala ku va tshika va famba.	But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go.
Kwalaho Faro a ku ka Muxe: Suka mahlweni ka mina u famba! Tivonele leswaku ni siku ni rin'we ndzi nga ha ku voni; loko ndzo ku vona, u file!	Then Pharaoh said to him, Get away from me; take care never to see my face again, for on the day you see my face you shall die.
Kutani Muxe a ku: Tanihilaha u vulaka hakona, u nga ka u nga ha ndzi voni, ni siku ni rin'we!	Moses said, As you say! I will not see your face again.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe: Ndza ha ta vangela Faro ni Vaegipta khombo rin'we ro hetelela; endzhaku ka swona, ú ta mi tshika mi famba; ku mi tshika ka swona, ú to mi hlongola kunene.	The LORD said to Moses, Yet one plague more I will bring upon Pharaoh and upon Egypt. Afterward he will let you go from here. When he lets you go, he will drive you away completely.
Sweswi, hlamusela Vaisraele, vavanuna ni vavasati, leswaku hinkwavo va kombela swo bomba ha swona swa silivhere ni nsuku eka vaakelani va vona.	Speak now in the hearing of the people, that they ask, every man of his neighbor and every woman of her neighbor, for silver and gold jewelry.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi endla leswaku Vaisraele va tsakeriwa hi Vaegipta. Naswona, etikweni ra Egipta, Muxe a a ri munhu wo chaviseka swinene emahlweni ka malandza ya Faro ni vaaki va tiko.	And the LORD gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover, the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants and in the sight of the people.
Kutani Muxe a ku ka Faro: HOSI Xikwembu xi vurisa sweswo xi ri: ‘Exikarhi ka vusiku, ndzi ta rhendzeleka na tiko ra Egipta.	So Moses said, Thus says the LORD: 'About midnight I will go out in the midst of Egypt
Xin'wana ni xin'wana lexi nga xa mativula etikweni ra Egipta, xi ta fa, ku sukela eka mativula ya Faro loyi vuhosi a byi ta va bya yena, ku fika ni le ka mativula ya nandza wa xisati loyi a silaka mavele, swi ya katsa ni mativula hinkwawo ya swifuwo.	and every firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne, even to the firstborn of the slave girl who is behind the handmill, and all the firstborn of the cattle.
Hikokwalaho, ematlhelweni hinkwawo ya tiko, ku ta va ni xirilo lexikulu exikarhi ka Vaegipta; xirilo lexo tano, a xi si tshama xi va kona, naswona a xi nga pfuki xi vile kona nakambe.	There shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there has never been, nor ever will be again.
Kasi, exikarhi ka Vaisraele hinkwavo, a ku nga vi na munhu kumbe xifuwo lexi nga ta vukuriwa hi mbyana. Hi kona mi nga ta tiva leswaku mina HOSI Xikwembu ndzi hlawula Vaisraele eka Vaegipta.’ 	But not a dog shall growl against any of the people of Israel, either man or beast, that you may know that the LORD makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel.'
Muxe a engeta a ku: Hikwalaho ka leswi, malandza ya wena hinkwawo, ma ta rhelela ma ta ka mina, ma ndzi nkhinsamela, ma ku: ‘Suka u famba, wena ni vanhu hinkwavo lava u va rhangelaka emahlweni.’ Kutani hi kona ndzi nga ta famba. Kwalaho Muxe a huma eka Faro a hlundzukile swinene.	And all these your servants shall come down to me and bow down to me, saying, 'Get out, you and all the people who follow you.' And after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in hot anger.
HOSI Xikwembu a xi byerile Muxe xi ku: Ku endlela leswaku swihlamariso swa mina swi andza etikweni ra Egipta, Faro a nga ka a nga ku yingisi.	Then the LORD said to Moses, Pharaoh will not listen to you, that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.
Hakunene, hambileswi Muxe na Aroni va endleke swihlamariso leswi emahlweni ka Faro, HOSI Xikwembu xi nonon'hwisile mbilu ya yena, kutani a ala ku tshika vanhu va Israele va famba, va huma etikweni ra yena.	Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh, and the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not let the people of Israel go out of his land.
HOSI Xikwembu xi byela Muxe na Aroni etikweni ra Egipta, xi ku	The LORD said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt
N'hweti leyi eka n'wina yi ta va yo sungula ya tin'hweti hinkwato, mi ta sungula lembe ha yona.	This month shall be for you the beginning of months. It shall be the first month of the year for you.
Vitanani Vaisraele hinkwavo, mi va byela leswaku, hi siku ra vukhume ra n'hweti leyi, va lavela mindyangu ya vona swinyimpfana kumbe swimbutana, xin'we hi ndyangu	Tell all the congregation of Israel that on the tenth day of this month every man shall take a lamb according to their fathers' houses, a lamb for a household.
loko va ndyangu wun'we va vona leswaku va ta tsandzeka ku dya xifuwo va heta va ri voxe, va fanele ku twanana ni vaakelani va vona, va lava xifuwo xin'we, va avelana xona hi ku landza nhlayo ya vona, ni leswi munhu un'wana ni un'wana a nga ta dya swona.	And if the household is too small for a lamb, then he and his nearest neighbor shall take according to the number of persons; according to what each can eat you shall make your count for the lamb.
Xifuwo xa kona xi fanele ku va xinyimpfana xa khuna kumbe ximbutana xa xiphongho, xa lembe rin'we, lexi nga solekiki	Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male a year old. You may take it from the sheep or from the goats
xi hlayisiwa ku fikela siku ra vu-14 ra n'hweti leyi, kutani hi siku leri, Vaisraele hinkwavo va ta hlengeletana, va tlhava swifuwo swa vona hi minkarhi ya madyambu.	and you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month, when the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill their lambs at twilight.
Kutani va fanele ku teka ngatinyana va xuva ha yona marimba ya timbanti ematlhelo ni le henhla, etindlwini leti va nga ta dyela eka tona nyama ya swifuwo.	Then they shall take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and the lintel of the houses in which they eat it.
Nyama leyi, yi fanele ku dyiwa vusiku bya kona, yi oxiwile kunene, va yi dya ni xinkwa xo-ke-comela, ni matsavu lama bavaka.	They shall eat the flesh that night, roasted on the fire; with unleavened bread and bitter herbs they shall eat it.
Nyama ya xifuwo yi nga tshuki yi dyiwa yi ri yimbisi, kumbe yi swekiwile hi mati hi mukhuva wihi na wihi; kambe a yi dyiwe yi oxiwile, ku oxiwa ni nhloko ya kona, ni manqina, ni swa le ndzeni.	Do not eat any of it raw or boiled in water, but roasted, its head with its legs and its inner parts.
Naswona, eka xona, ku nga tshuki ku va ni leswi nga ta salela mundzuku; loko ri xa ka ha sale swin'wana, swi hiseni.	And you shall let none of it remain until the morning; anything that remains until the morning you shall burn.
Loko mi dya xifuwo lexi, mi fanele ku va mi tikhamile, mi ambarile tintanghu, mi khomile tinhonga emavokweni; naswona, mi dya hi ku hatlisa. Hi wona nkhuvo wa Paseka lowu endleriwaka mina HOSI.	In this manner you shall eat it: with your belt fastened, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand. And you shall eat it in haste. It is the LORD's Passover.
Hi vusiku byebyo, ndzi ta tsemakanya tiko ra Egipta, ndzi lovisa mativula hinkwawo ya Vaegipta, mativula ya vanhu ni ya swifuwo; swikwembu hinkwaswo swa Egipta, ndzi ta swi avanyisa: Hi mina HOSI.	For I will pass through the land of Egypt that night, and I will strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and on all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: I am the LORD.
Loko mi ri n'wina, swi ta tikomba hi ngati lomu mi nga ta va mi ri kona; loko ndzi vona ngati, ndzi ta hundza ntsena ndzi nga mi khumbi. Khombo a ri nga mi weli ri mi herisa, loko ndzi ri karhi ndzi lovisa tiko ra Egipta.	The blood shall be a sign for you, on the houses where you are. And when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and no plague will befall you to destroy you, when I strike the land of Egypt.
Siku leri, mi fanele ku ri tsundzuka; ri ta va siku leri mi nga ta endla nkhuvo wo tlangela HOSI Xikwembu ha rona. Nkhuvo lowu wu ta va xiboho ni le ka hinkwavo lava nga ta velekiwa, hilaha ku nga heriki.	This day shall be for you a memorial day, and you shall keep it as a feast to the LORD; throughout your generations, as a statute forever, you shall keep it as a feast.
Hi masiku ya 7, mi fanele ku dya xinkwa xo-ke-comela. Hi siku ro sungula, susani comela emindyangwini ya n'wina, hikuva munhu loyi a nga ta dya leswi nga ni comela exikarhi ka masiku lawa ya 7, ú ta hlongoriwa erixakeni ra Israele.	Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread. On the first day you shall remove leaven out of your houses, for if anyone eats what is leavened, from the first day until the seventh day, that person shall be cut off from Israel.
Hi siku ro sungula, mi fanele ku hlengeletana mi gandzela HOSI Xikwembu, ni le ka siku ra vu-7 a swi ve tano. Hi masiku lawa, mi nga tshuki mi endla ntirho ni wun'we; ntsena un'wana ni un'wana a nga tiswekela swakudya leswi a nga ta dya swona.	On the first day you shall hold a holy assembly, and on the seventh day a holy assembly. No work shall be done on those days. But what everyone needs to eat, that alone may be prepared by you.
Hlayisani siku leri ra nkhuvo wa xinkwa xo-ke-comela, hikuva hi rona siku leri ndzi humeseke mintshungu ya n'wina etikweni ra Egipta ha rona; ri endleni siku ra xiboho, eka n'wina ni ka lava nga ta velekiwa, hilaha ku nga heriki.	And you shall observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread, for on this very day I brought your hosts out of the land of Egypt. Therefore you shall observe this day, throughout your generations, as a statute forever.
Ku sukela madyambu ya siku ra vu-14 eka n'hweti yo sungula, ku ya fikela madyambu ya siku ra 21, mi fanele ku dya xinkwa lexo-ke-comela.	In the first month, from the fourteenth day of the month at evening, you shall eat unleavened bread until the twenty-first day of the month at evening.
Eka masiku lawa ya 7, mi nga tshuki mi va ni comela emindyangwini ya n'wina, hikuva munhu loyi a nga ta dya leswi nga ni comela, hambi a ri muluveri kumbe munhu wa rixaka ra Israele, ú ta hlongoriwa exikarhi ka Vaisraele.	For seven days no leaven is to be found in your houses. If anyone eats what is leavened, that person will be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he is a sojourner or a native of the land.
Emindyangwini ya n'wina, mi fanele ku dya xinkwa xo-ke-comela, mi nga tshuki mi dya lexi nga ni comela.	You shall eat nothing leavened; in all your dwelling places you shall eat unleavened bread.
Kutani Muxe a vitana vakulukumba va Israele hinkwavo, a ku ka vona: Hatlisani mi lavela mindyangu ya n'wina swinyimpfana, mi swi tlhavela nkhuvo wa Paseka.	Then Moses called all the elders of Israel and said to them, Go and select lambs for yourselves according to your clans, and kill the Passover lamb.
Tshovani rhavi ra ximudyana xa hisopa, mi ri peta enkambanini lowu nga ni ngati ya xifuwo, kutani mi xuva ha yona marimba ya rivanti, ematlhelo ni le henhla; naswona ku nga tshuki ku va na un'we wa n'wina loyi a humaka endlwini ya yena ku kondza ri xa.	Take a bunch of hyssop and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and touch the lintel and the two doorposts with the blood that is in the basin. None of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning.
Kutani loko HOSI Xikwembu xi tsemakanya tiko ra Vaegipta ku va lovisa, xi ta vona ngati erimbeni ra le henhla ni le marimbeni ya le matlhelo ya rivanti, kutani xi ta ri hundza ntsena; xi nga ka xi nga pfumeleri loyi a rhumiweke ku dlaya, a nghena etindlwini ta n'wina ku ta mi lovisa.	For the LORD will pass through to strike the Egyptians, and when he sees the blood on the lintel and on the two doorposts, the LORD will pass over the door and will not allow the destroyer to enter your houses to strike you.
Timhaka leti, mi fanele ku ti hlayisa; a ti ve xiboho, eka n'wina ni ka vatukulu va n'wina, hilaha ku nga heriki.	You shall observe this rite as a statute for you and for your sons forever.
Loko mi fika etikweni leri HOSI Xikwembu xi tshembiseke ku mi nyika rona, mi ta hlayisa maendlele lawa ya nkhuvo.	And when you come to the land that the LORD will give you, as he has promised, you shall keep this service.
Kutani loko vana va n'wina va mi vutisa va ku: ‘Xana mi endlela yini nkhuvo lowu xana?’	And when your children say to you, 'What do you mean by this service?'
mi ta va hlamula, mi ku: ‘Leri i gandzelo ra nkhuvo wa Paseka wo tlangela HOSI Xikwembu, hikuva xi hundzile ntsena xi nga khumbi tindlu ta Vaisraele le Egipta, loko xi ri karhi xi lovisa Vaegipta, kutani xi tsetselerile mindyangu ya hina.’ 
Kavaloko Vaisraele va nkhinsama hi matsolo, va khongela	you shall say, 'It is the sacrifice of the LORD's Passover, for he passed over the houses of the people of Israel in Egypt, when he struck the Egyptians but spared our houses.' And the people bowed their heads and worshiped.
kutani va ya endla hilaha HOSI Xikwembu xi leriseke Muxe na Aroni ha kona.	Then the people of Israel went and did so; as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did.
Exikarhi ka vusiku, HOSI Xikwembu xi lovisa mativula hinkwawo etikweni ra Egipta, ku sukela eka mativula ya Faro loyi vuhosi a byi ta va bya yena, ku fika eka mativula ya lava khomiweke enyimpini va pfaleriwa, ni le ka mativula hinkwawo ya swifuwo.	At midnight the LORD struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the dungeon, and all the firstborn of the livestock.
Vusiku byebyo, Faro ni malandza ya yena hinkwawo, ni vanhu hinkwavo va Egipta, va pfuka; etikweni hinkwaro ra Egipta, a ku ri ni nkosi lowukulu, hikuva a ku ri hava muti lowu a ku nga ri na rifu eka wona.	And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he and all his servants and all the Egyptians. And there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was not a house where someone was not dead.
Kutani Faro a vitana Muxe na Aroni ka ha ri vusiku, a ku ka vona: Hatlisani mi suka exikarhi ka vanhu va mina; tekani Vaisraele mi huma na vona etikweni, mi ya humesela HOSI Xikwembu emagandzelo, hilaha mi kombeleke hakona!	Then he summoned Moses and Aaron by night and said, Up, go out from among my people, both you and the people of Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as you have said.
Tekani tinyimpfu ni timbuti ni tihomu ta n'wina, hilaha mi kombeleke hakona, kutani mi huma etikweni. Na mina, mi ndzi kombelela minkateko!	Take your flocks and your herds, as you have said, and be gone, and bless me also!
Vanhu va Egipta va hatlisisa Vaisraele, va va hlongola etikweni, hikuva a va ku: Hi ta fa hi hela hinkwerhu.	The Egyptians were urgent with the people to send them out of the land in haste. For they said, We shall all be dead.
Kutani Vaisraele va teka mapa yo pfuva xinkwa ma nga si cheriwa comela, va famba na wona, va phutsela swibya swo pfuvela eka swona hi minceka ya vona, kutani va swi pakatsa emakatleni.	So the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading bowls being bound up in their cloaks on their shoulders.
Vaisraele va endla ni leswi Muxe a a va lerisile swona: Va kombela swo bomba ha swona swa silivhere ni nsuku eka Vaegipta, va kombela ni swo ambala.	The people of Israel had also done as Moses told them, for they had asked the Egyptians for silver and gold jewelry and for clothing.
Naswona, HOSI Xikwembu xi endla leswaku Vaisraele va tsakeriwa hi Vaegipta, va nyikiwa leswi va swi kombelaka. Hi ndlela leyi, Vaisraele va tekela Vaegipta swilo swa vona.	And the LORD had given the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they let them have what they asked. Thus they plundered the Egyptians.
Kutani Vaisraele va suka eRamsese, va khoma ndlela yo ya eSukoti, hi milenge; a va ri vavanuna va kwalomu ka 600 000, ni mindyangu ya vona.	And the people of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides women and children.
Va fambile ni vanhu lavo tala va tinxaka tin'wana, ni mintlhambi yo tala ngopfu ya tinyimpfu ni timbuti ni tihomu.	A mixed multitude also went up with them, and very much livestock, both flocks and herds.
Leswi va nga kumangiki ni nkarhi wo tiswekela timbuva, hikwalaho ka ku hlongoriwa etikweni ra Egipta, va tiswekerile swinkwa leswo-ke-comela hi mapa lawa va humeke na wona le Egipta, lawa va nga ma pfuva ma nga ri na comela.	And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough that they had brought out of Egypt, for it was not leavened, because they were thrust out of Egypt and could not wait, nor had they prepared any provisions for themselves.
Vanhu va Israele va tshamile malembe ya 430 etikweni na Egipta.	The time that the people of Israel lived in Egypt was 430 years.
Loko ku hundzile malembe ya 430, hi siku roleri ra nkhuvo, mintshungu hinkwayo ya HOSI Xikwembu yi humile etikweni ra Egipta.	At the end of 430 years, on that very day, all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.
Vusiku lebyi, eka HOSI Xikwembu byi vile bya murindzelo wa ku humesa Vaisraele etikweni ra Egipta; hikokwalaho, eka Vaisraele hinkwavo va minkarhi hinkwayo, vusiku byolebyi i bya murindzelo wa ku tlangela HOSI Xikwembu.	It was a night of watching by the LORD, to bring them out of the land of Egypt; so this same night is a night of watching kept to the LORD by all the people of Israel throughout their generations.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi tivisa Muxe na Aroni milawu ya Paseka, xi ku:
Ku nga vi na muluveri na un'we la dyaka
nkhuvo wa Paseka.	And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, This is the statute of the Passover: no foreigner shall eat of it
Hlonga rin'wana ni rin'wana leri xaviweke hi mali, ri nga dya, loko mi rhangile hi ku ri yimbisa.	but every slave that is bought for money may eat of it after you have circumcised him.
Munhu wo ta a famba, ni munhu loyi a thoriweke, va nga tshuki va dya Paseka.	No foreigner or hired worker may eat of it.
Xifuwo xa Paseka xi fanele ku dyeriwa endlwini leyi xi tlhaveriweke eka yona. Ku nga tshuki ku va ni nyama niyitsongo leyi tekiwaka yi humeseriwa ehandle; naswona, mi nga tshuki mi tshova rhambu ni rin'we ra xifuwo xa kona.	It shall be eaten in one house; you shall not take any of the flesh outside the house, and you shall not break any of its bones.
Ntshungu hinkwawo wa Vaisraele wu fanele ku dya nkhuvo lowu.	All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.
Loko munhu wa le handle a luverile eka n'wina, kutani a navela ku tlangela HOSI Xikwembu hi ku dya nkhuvo wa Paseka, vavanuna va muti wa yena hinkwavo va fanele ku yimbisiwa; hi kona a nga ta nghena enkhubyeni wa Paseka a dya; ú ta langutiwa ku fana ni munhu loyi a velekiweke etikweni ra Israele. Kambe ku nga vi na munhu na un'we wo ka a nga yimbisiwanga, la nga ta dya Paseka.	If a stranger shall sojourn with you and would keep the Passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised. Then he may come near and keep it; he shall be as a native of the land. But no uncircumcised person shall eat of it.
Eka munhu wa rixaka ra Israele, ni le ka munhu wa le handle loyi a luveleke erixakeni ra Israele, ku ta tirha nawu wun'we.	There shall be one law for the native and for the stranger who sojourns among you.
Kutani Vaisraele hinkwavo va endla hinkwaswo leswi HOSI Xikwembu xi leriseke Muxe na Aroni, va nga siyi nchumu.	All the people of Israel did just as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron.
Hi siku rorero ra nkhuvo, HOSI Xikwembu xi humesile Vaisraele etikweni ra Egipta, hi mintshungu ya vona.	And on that very day the LORD brought the people of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their hosts.
HOSI Xikwembu xi lerisa Muxe xi ku	The LORD said to Moses
U fanele ku hlawula mativula hinkwawo ya vanhu ni ya swifuwo, u ma nyiketa eka mina; hinkwaswo leswi rhangeke ku velekiwa, exikarhi ka Vaisraele kumbe eka swifuwo swa vona, i swa mina.	Consecrate to me all the firstborn. Whatever is the first to open the womb among the people of Israel, both of man and of beast, is mine.
Kutani Muxe a byela vanhu, a ku: Siku leri, mi nga tshuki mi ri rivala, hikuva hi rona siku leri HOSI Xikwembu xi mi humeseke hi matimba ya xona etikweni ra Egipta, laha a mi ri mahlonga kona. Hi siku leri, mi nga tshuki mi dya xinkwa lexi nga ni comela.	Then Moses said to the people, Remember this day in which you came out from Egypt, out of the house of slavery, for by a strong hand the LORD brought you out from this place. No leavened bread shall be eaten.
Namuntlha, hi n'hweti leyi ya Abibi, ma huma etikweni ra Egipta.	Today, in the month of Abib, you are going out.
Kutani mi hamba mi endla nkhuvo lowu hi n'hweti yoleyi, loko HOSI Xikwembu xi ta va xi mi fikisile etikweni leri xi tshembiseke vatata wa n'wina leswaku xi ta mi nyika rona, ri nga tiko ra Vakanana, ni Vahiti, ni Vaamori, ni Vahivhi, ni Vayebusi, leri khulukaka ntswamba ni vulombe.	And when the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, you shall keep this service in this month.
Mi fanele ku dya xinkwa lexo-ke-comela masiku ya 7, kutani hi siku ro hetelela ri nga ra vu-7, mi endla nkhuvo wo tlangela HOSI Xikwembu.	Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there shall be a feast to the LORD.
Hi masiku lawa ya 7, mi dya xinkwa lexo-ke-comela ntsena; mi nga tshuki mi va ni xinkwa xa comela, kumbe comela hi xoxe, emitini ya n'wina hinkwayo.	Unleavened bread shall be eaten for seven days; no leavened bread shall be seen with you, and no leaven shall be seen with you in all your territory.
Hi siku rero ra nkhuvo, mi fanele ku byela vana va n'wina, mi ku: ‘Hi endla leswi hikwalaho ka mintirho leyi HOSI Xikwembu xi hi endleleke yona, siku hi humeke le Egipta.’	You shall tell your son on that day, 'It is because of what the LORD did for me when I came out of Egypt.'
Nkhuvo lowu wu ta va xitsundzuxo eka n'wina, ku fana ni loko mi bohile xanchumu evokweni kumbe emombyeni, leswaku mi ta kala mi nga rivali ku twarisa ni ku dyondzisa nawu wa HOSI Xikwembu, hikuva xi mi humesile etikweni ra Egipta hi matimba ya xona lamakulu.	And it shall be to you as a sign on your hand and as a memorial between your eyes, that the law of the LORD may be in your mouth. For with a strong hand the LORD has brought you out of Egypt.
Hikokwalaho, swa mi boha ku endla nkhuvo lowu lembe rin'wana ni rin'wana, hi nkarhi lowu vekiweke.	You shall therefore keep this statute at its appointed time from year to year.
HOSI Xikwembu xi ta mi nghenisa etikweni ra Vakanana, hilaha xi mi tshembiseke hakona, n'wina ni vatata wa n'wina; kutani xi ta mi nyika rona	When the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites, as he swore to you and your fathers, and shall give it to you
hikokwalaho, mi ta hlawula hinkwaswo leswi rhangeke ku velekiwa, mi swi nyiketa eka HOSI Xikwembu. Mativula hinkwawo ya xinuna ya swifuwo swa n'wina ma ta va ya HOSI Xikwembu.	you shall set apart to the LORD all that first opens the womb. All the firstborn of your animals that are males shall be the LORD's.
Ematshan'wini ya ximbhongolwana xin'wana ni xin'wana xa xinuna xa mativula, mi fanele ku tlhava xinyimpfana kumbe ximbutana; loko mi nga tsakeli ku tlhava nchumu ematshan'wini ya ximbhongolwana, xi tshoveni nhamu; kambe ematshan'wini ya vana va n'wina hinkwavo va mativula va xinuna, mi ta tlhava xifuwo.	Every firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb, or if you will not redeem it you shall break its neck. Every firstborn of man among your sons you shall redeem.
Kutani eka minkarhi leyi taka, loko vana va n'wina va mi vutisa va ku: ‘Xana leswi swi vula yini xana?’ mi ta va hlamula mi ku: ‘HOSI Xikwembu xi hi humesile hi matimba ya xona lamakulu etikweni ra Egipta, laha a hi ri mahlonga kona.	And when in time to come your son asks you, 'What does this mean?' you shall say to him, 'By a strong hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt, from the house of slavery.
Loko Faro a tinonon'hwisile a ala ku hi tshika hi famba, HOSI Xikwembu xi herisile mativula hinkwawo ya xinuna ya vanhu ni ya swifuwo etikweni ra Egipta. Hikokwalaho hi humeselaka HOSI Xikwembu emagandzelo hi swa xinuna hinkwaswo leswi rhangeke ku velekiwa; kambe ematshan'wini ya vana va hina va mativula va xinuna, hi tlhava xifuwo.’	For when Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, the LORD killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man and the firstborn of animals. Therefore I sacrifice to the LORD all the males that first open the womb, but all the firstborn of my sons I redeem.'
Leswi swi ta va xitsundzuxo eka n'wina, ku fana ni loko mi bohile xanchumu evokweni kumbe emombyeni, hikuva HOSI Xikwembu xi hi humesile etikweni ra Egipta hi matimba ya xona lamakulu.	It shall be as a mark on your hand or frontlets between your eyes, for by a strong hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt.
Loko Faro a tshikile Vaisraele va famba, Xikwembu a xi va pfumelelanga ku famba hi ndlela yo hundza hi le tikweni ra Vafilista, hambi leswi a yi tsemakanya, hikuva a xi ehleketa leswaku loko va tshuka va hlanganile ni tinyimpi, va ta hela ntamu, va tlhelela etikweni ra Egipta.	When Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them by way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near. For God said, Lest the people change their minds when they see war and return to Egypt.
Kambe Xikwembu xi va rhendzelekisile hi ndlela ya mananga, leyi kongomaka Lwandle-ro-Tshwuka, va hlomile matlhari.	But God led the people around by the way of the wilderness toward the Red Sea. And the people of Israel went up out of the land of Egypt equipped for battle.
Muxe a a tekile ni marhambu ya Yosefa, hikuva Yosefa a a lerisile Vaisraele ku hlambanya leswaku va ta endla sweswo a ku: Xikwembu xi ta ta xi ta mi kutsula, kutani mi fanele ku teka marhambu ya mina laha tikweni leri, mi famba na wona.	Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for Joseph had made the sons of Israel solemnly swear, saying, God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones with you from here.
Kutani Vaisraele va suka eSukoti, va famba va ko va ya gova le Etamu, laha mananga ma sungulaka kona.	And they moved on from Succoth and encamped at Etham, on the edge of the wilderness.
Ninhlekanhi, HOSI Xikwembu a xi va rhangela hi ku nembeleta papa emahlweni ka vona, xi va komba ndlela, kasi nivusiku, a xi nembeleta ndzilo, xi va voningela ndlela, leswaku va ta kota ku famba vusiku ni nhlekanhi.	And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them along the way, and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, that they might travel by day and by night.
Papa leri a ri nembelela ninhlekanhi, ni ndzilo lowu a wu pfurha nivusiku, a swi nga suki emahlweni ka Vaisraele.	The pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night did not depart from before the people.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe	Then the LORD said to Moses
Byela Vaisraele leswaku va tlhelela endzhaku, va ya gova emahlweni ka muti wa Pi-Hahiroto, exikarhi ka Migidolo ni lwandle; mi fanele ku gova kusuhi ni muti wa Baala-Sefoni, eribuweni ra lwandle.	Tell the people of Israel to turn back and encamp in front of Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, in front of Baal-zephon; you shall encamp facing it, by the sea.
Hikokwalaho Faro ú ta ehleketa leswaku Vaisraele va pepetseka na tiko, ni leswaku mananga ma va siverile ndlela.	For Pharaoh will say of the people of Israel, 'They are wandering in the land; the wilderness has shut them in.'
Mina ndzi ta nonon'hwisa mbilu ya Faro, kutani ú ta landza Vaisraele; hi ndlela leyi, ndzi ta dzunisiwa swinene, hi mhaka ya leswi swi nga ta humelela eka Faro ni mavuthu ya yena; naswona Vaegipta va ta tiva leswaku hi mina ndzi nga HOSI. Kutani Vaisraele va endla hilaha va lerisiweke hakona.	And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he will pursue them, and I will get glory over Pharaoh and all his host, and the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD. And they did so.
Loko hosi Faro a byeriwa leswaku Vaisraele va balekile, yena ni malandza ya yena va hundzuluxa miehleketo ya vona hi tlhelo ra Vaisraele, kutani va ku: Hi endlile yini xana? Hi tshikile Vaisraele va famba, kasi a va hi tirhela!	When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, the mind of Pharaoh and his servants was changed toward the people, and they said, What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us?
Kutani Faro a pana kalichi ra yena, a vitana ni mavuthu ya yena.	So he made ready his chariot and took his army with him
Faro a famba ni makalichi ya yena ya 600 layo tiya, a teka ni makalichi laman'wana hinkwawo ya tiko ra Egipta, kalichi rin'wana ni rin'wana ri ri ni mufambisi wa rona.	and took six hundred chosen chariots and all the other chariots of Egypt with officers over all of them.
HOSI Xikwembu xi nonon'hwisa mbilu ya Faro hosi ya Egipta, kutani a landza Vaisraele loko va ri karhi va huma va ntshunxekile swinene.	And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued the people of Israel while the people of Israel were going out defiantly.
Vaegipta va landza Vaisraele va ri ni makalichi hinkwawo ya Faro ni tihanci ta kona ni vagadi va tihanci ni mavuthu ya Faro, va ya va kuma va govile eribuweni ra lwandle, emahlweni ka muti wa Pi-Hahiroto, kusuhi na Baala-Sefoni.	The Egyptians pursued them, all Pharaoh's horses and chariots and his horsemen and his army, and overtook them encamped at the sea, by Pi-hahiroth, in front of Baal-zephon.
Loko Vaisraele va tlakusa mahlo, va vona Faro a ri karhi a ta, kutani va tshuka swinene, hikuva Vaegipta a va va landza. Vaisraele va huwelela eka HOSI Xikwembu	When Pharaoh drew near, the people of Israel lifted up their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians were marching after them, and they feared greatly. And the people of Israel cried out to the LORD.
kutani va ku ka Muxe: Xana ku kala u hi humesa etikweni ra Egipta leswaku hi ta fela laha mananga, a ku lo pfumaleka masirha le Egipta xana ke? Kutani swi hi pfune yini loko u hi humesile le Egipta ke?	They said to Moses, Is it because there are no graves in Egypt that you have taken us away to die in the wilderness? What have you done to us in bringing us out of Egypt?
Xana a hi ku byelanga mhaka leyi loko ha ha ri le Egipta, hi ku: ‘U nga hi karhati, hi tshike hi tirhela Vaegipta!’ xana? Eka hina, a swi ta antswa ku tirhela Vaegipta, ku ri na ku ta fela laha mananga!	Is not this what we said to you in Egypt: 'Leave us alone that we may serve the Egyptians'? For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness.
Kutani Muxe a hlamula vanhu a ku: Mi nga chavi nchumu, tiyisani timbilu, mi vona leswi HOSI Xikwembu xi nga ta swi endla namuntlha ku mi ponisa. Vaegipta lava mi va vonaka namuntlha, a mi nga ha va voni kambe ni siku ni rin'we.	And Moses said to the people, Fear not, stand firm, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will work for you today. For the Egyptians whom you see today, you shall never see again.
HOSI Xikwembu, hi xona xi nga ta mi lwela, n'wina mo miyela mi ku whííí!	The LORD will fight for you, and you have only to be silent.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe: Xana u huwelela u lava yini eka mina xana? Byela Vaisraele leswaku va famba va ya emahlweni.	The LORD said to Moses, Why do you cry to me? Tell the people of Israel to go forward.
Teka nhonga ya wena, u yi tlakusela ehenhla ka lwandle, u hambanisa mati hi le xikarhi, leswaku Vaisraele va ta pela laha ku omeke.	Lift up your staff, and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it, that the people of Israel may go through the sea on dry ground.
Mina ndzi ta nonon'hwisa timbilu ta Vaegipta leswaku va ta nghena elwandle va landza Vaisraele; kutani ndzi ta dzunisiwa swinene hi mhaka ya leswi swi nga ta humelela eka Faro, ni le ka mavuthu ni makalichi ya yena, ni le ka vagadi va tihanci ta yena.	And I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they shall go in after them, and I will get glory over Pharaoh and all his host, his chariots, and his horsemen.
Loko ndzi dzunisiwa hi mhaka ya Faro ni makalichi ya yena ni vagadi va tihanci ta yena, hi kona Vaegipta va nga ta swi tiva leswaku hi mina ndzi nga HOSI.	And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have gotten glory over Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen.
Kutani ntsumi ya Xikwembu leyi a yi rhangela mintshungu ya Vaisraele, yi suka yi ya endzhaku ka vona. Na rona papa leri a ri nembelela emahlweni ka vona ri suka ri ya yima hi le ndzhaku ka vona	Then the angel of God who was going before the host of Israel moved and went behind them, and the pillar of cloud moved from before them and stood behind them
exikarhi ka mintshungu ya vona ni mavuthu ya Vaegipta. Kutani papa ri vanga xinyami; vusiku byi hundza, Vaegipta va nga kotanga ku tshinelela Vaisraele.	coming between the host of Egypt and the host of Israel. And there was the cloud and the darkness. And it lit up the night without one coming near the other all night.
Muxe a tlakusela voko ra yena ehenhla ka lwandle; kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi tlhengusa mati ya lwandle hi ku hungisa moya lowukulu vusiku hinkwabyo, wu huma evuxeni; mati ma avana hi le xikarhi, ehansi ku sala ku omile	Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the LORD drove the sea back by a strong east wind all night and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.
kutani Vaisraele va nghena elwandle, va famba laha ku omeke; mati a ma endlile makhumbi hi tlhelo ra vona ra xinene ni lera ximatsi.	And the people of Israel went into the midst of the sea on dry ground, the waters being a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.
Kutani Vaegipta va hlongorisa Vaisraele va va landza hi le ndzhaku. Va fika va nghena elwandle va ri ni tihanci ta Faro hinkwato, ni makalichi, ni vagadi va tihanci ta yena.	The Egyptians pursued and went in after them into the midst of the sea, all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.
Loko ri ya eku xeni, HOSI Xikwembu xi languta mavuthu ya Vaegipta xi ri epapeni leri nembeleleke ni le ndzilweni, kutani xi va hlanganisa tinhloko	And in the morning watch the LORD in the pillar of fire and of cloud looked down on the Egyptian forces and threw the Egyptian forces into a panic
Xi bodlhomerisa mavhilwa ya makalichi ya vona endzhopeni, leswaku ma famba hi ku nonoka; kutani Vaegipta va ku: A hi tsutsumeni hi tshika Vaisraele, hikuva HOSI Xikwembu hi xona xi va lwelaka eka hina Vaegipta.	clogging their chariot wheels so that they drove heavily. And the Egyptians said, Let us flee from before Israel, for the LORD fights for them against the Egyptians.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe: Tlakusela voko ra wena ehenhla ka lwandle, leswaku mati ma ta tlhela ma vuya ma khubumeta Vaegipta ni makalichi ya vona ni tihanci ta vona.	Then the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the water may come back upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.
Hiloko Muxe a tlakusela voko ra yena ehenhla ka lwandle; kutani hi vurhonga mati ma tlhelela ematshan'wini ya wona. Loko Vaegipta va tsutsuma, va hlangana na wona, kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi va tshika va dyiwa hi mati ya lwandle.	So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its normal course when the morning appeared. And as the Egyptians fled into it, the LORD threw the Egyptians into the midst of the sea.
Kutani mati ma vuya, ma khubumeta makalichi, ni vagadi va tihanci, ni mavuthu ya Faro hinkwawo lawa a ma nghenile elwandle ma landza Vaisraele; a ku salanga munhu ni un'we.	The waters returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen; of all the host of Pharaoh that had followed them into the sea, not one of them remained.
Kambe Vaisraele vona va pele lwandle va famba laha ku omeke, mati ma va endlele makhumbi exineneni ni le ximatsini.	But the people of Israel walked on dry ground through the sea, the waters being a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.
Hi siku rero, HOSI Xikwembu xi ponisisa sweswo Vaisraele emavokweni ya Vaegipta, kutani Vaisraele va vona mintsumbu ya Vaegipta eribuweni ra lwandle.	Thus the LORD saved Israel that day from the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore.
Vaisraele va vona leswi HOSI Xikwembu xi swi endleke loko xi lwa ni Vaegipta hi matimba ya xona lamakulu, va xi chava ngopfu, kutani va pfumela eka xona ni le ka nandza wa xona Muxe.	Israel saw the great power that the LORD used against the Egyptians, so the people feared the LORD, and they believed in the LORD and in his servant Moses.
HOSI Xikwembu xi ta fuma
hilaha ku nga heriki.	The LORD will reign forever and ever.
Kuteloko tihanci ta Faro ti nghenile elwandle, ni makalichi ya yena ni vagadi va tihanci ta yena, HOSI Xikwembu xi vuyisa mati ma va khubumeta; kambe Vaisraele vona va famba exikarhi ka lwandle laha ku omeke.	For when the horses of Pharaoh with his chariots and his horsemen went into the sea, the LORD brought back the waters of the sea upon them, but the people of Israel walked on dry ground in the midst of the sea.
Muprofeta Meriyamu, loyi a a ri makwavo wa Aroni, a teka xingomana; vavasati hinkwavo va huma va n'wi landza, va ri karhi va khankha, va khomile swingomana swa vona.	Then Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a tambourine in her hand, and all the women went out after her with tambourines and dancing.
Kutani Muxe a suka na Vaisraele eLwandle-ro-Tshwuka, va kongoma emananga ya Xuru. Va famba emananga lawa masiku manharhu, va nga kumi mati.	Then Moses made Israel set out from the Red Sea, and they went into the wilderness of Shur. They went three days in the wilderness and found no water.
Kutani va ya fika endhawini leyi va nge i Mara, kambe va tsandzeka ku nwa mati ya kona, hikuva a ma dzunga ngopfu; hi swona leswi endleke leswaku ndhawu leyi yi thyiwa vito ra Mara, (hileswaku ku dzunga).	When they came to Marah, they could not drink the water of Marah because it was bitter; therefore it was named Marah.
Hiloko vanhu va dzumadzumela Muxe va ku: Hi ta nwa yini xana?	And the people grumbled against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?
Kutani xi ku ka vona: Loko mi tinyiketa ku yingisa leswi mina HOSI Xikwembu xa n'wina ndzi mi byelaka swona, mi endla leswi swi ndzi tsakisaka, mi landza milawu ya mina ni ku hlayisa swileriso swa mina hinkwaswo, ndzi nga ka ndzi nga mi vangeli ni ntungu ni wun'we wo fana ni leyi ndzi yi vangeleke Vaegipta, hikuva hi mina HOSI Xikwembu, mutshunguri wa n'wina.	saying, If you will diligently listen to the voice of the LORD your God, and do that which is right in his eyes, and give ear to his commandments and keep all his statutes, I will put none of the diseases on you that I put on the Egyptians, for I am the LORD, your healer.
Kutani va famba va ya fika le Elimi, laha a ku ri ni swihlovo swa 12 ni mirhi ya 70 ya mincindzu; va fika va dzima mintsonga, kusuhi ni mati.	Then they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees, and they encamped there by the water.
Ntshungu hinkwawo wa Vaisraele wu suka Elimi, kutani hi siku ra vu-15 ra n'hweti ya vumbirhi endzhaku ka loko wu sukile le Egipta, wu fika emananga ya Sina lama nga exikarhi ka Elimi na Sinayi.	They set out from Elim, and all the congregation of the people of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after they had departed from the land of Egypt.
Kutani ntshungu lowu wa Vaisraele hinkwawo wu dzumadzumela Muxe na Aroni, kwale mananga	And the whole congregation of the people of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness
wu ku: A swi ta antswa loko ingi HOSI Xikwembu xi hi lovisile ha ha ri etikweni ra Egipta, laha a hi tseleka timbita ta nyama, hi dya vuswa hi xurha, ku ri na ku hi humesa mi hi tisa laha mananga, mi ta dlayisa ntshungu lowu hinkwawo hi ndlala!	and the people of Israel said to them, Would that we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the meat pots and ate bread to the full, for you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger.
HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe: Ndzi ta mi rhumela vuswa byi huma etilweni; kutani siku rin'wana ni rin'wana vanhu va fanele ku huma va ya hlengeleta swo ringana ku dya siku rin'we ntsena. Ndzi lava ku va kambela, ku vona loko va ta yingisa kumbe va nga yingisi nawu wa mina.	Then the LORD said to Moses, Behold, I am about to rain bread from heaven for you, and the people shall go out and gather a day's portion every day, that I may test them, whether they will walk in my law or not.
Kutani hi siku ra vu-6 loko va sweka leswi va nga vuya na swona ekaya, swi ta tala swi ringana ni leswi swi hlengeletiwaka masiku mambirhi.	On the sixth day, when they prepare what they bring in, it will be twice as much as they gather daily.
Kutani Muxe na Aroni va byela Vaisraele hinkwavo, va ku: Madyambu ya namuntlha, mi ta swi tiva leswaku loyi a mi humeseke etikweni ra Egipta i HOSI Xikwembu.	So Moses and Aaron said to all the people of Israel, At evening you shall know that it was the LORD who brought you out of the land of Egypt
Kutani mundzuku nimpundzu, mi ta vona ku vonakala ka HOSI Xikwembu, hikuva xi twile loko mi xi dzumadzumela. Xana hina hi vamani, leswi mi hi dzumadzumelaka, xana?	and in the morning you shall see the glory of the LORD, because he has heard your grumbling against the LORD. For what are we, that you grumble against us?
Muxe a tlhela a ku: HOSI Xikwembu hi xona lexi nga ta mi nyika nyama mi dya nimadyambu, ni vuswa lebyi mi nga ta dya mi xurha nimpundzu, hikuva xi mi twile loko mi xi dzumadzumela. Xana hina hi vamani xana? Loko mi dzumadzuma, a mi dzumadzumeli hina, kambe mi dzumadzumela HOSI Xikwembu.	And Moses said, When the LORD gives you in the evening meat to eat and in the morning bread to the full, because the LORD has heard your grumbling that you grumble against him—what are we? Your grumbling is not against us but against the LORD.
Kutani Muxe a byela Aroni a ku: Tivisa ntshungu hinkwawo wa Vaisraele leswaku wu tshinela emahlweni ka HOSI Xikwembu, hikuva ku dzumadzuma ka vona xi ku twile.	Then Moses said to Aaron, Say to the whole congregation of the people of Israel, 'Come near before the LORD, for he has heard your grumbling.'
Loko Aroni a ri karhi a vulavula ni ntshungu hinkwawo wa Vaisraele, va languta etlhelo ra mananga, kutani va vona ku kwetsima ka HOSI Xikwembu epapeni.	And as soon as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the people of Israel, they looked toward the wilderness, and behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe	And the LORD said to Moses
Ku dzumadzuma ka Vaisraele, ndzi ku twile! Va tivise leswaku namadyambu va ta dya nyama, nimpundzu va ta dya vuswa va xurha; kutani hi kona va nga ta tiva leswaku mina HOSI, ndzi Xikwembu xa vona!	I have heard the grumbling of the people of Israel. Say to them, 'At twilight you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread. Then you shall know that I am the LORD your God.'
Ni madyambu ya siku rero, ku humelela switsatsatsa, swi fika swi phatsama swi tala laha a va govile kona. Nimpundzu siku leri tlhandlamaka, a ku ri ni mberha leyo tala matlhelo hinkwawo ya mintsonga ya vona.	In the evening quail came up and covered the camp, and in the morning dew lay around the camp.
Kutani loko mberha yi dzudzekile, a ku ri ni swin'wana erivaleni swo fana ni tindzhohonyana, swo vevuka ku fana ni gwitsi leri weleke ehansi.	And when the dew had gone up, there was on the face of the wilderness a fine, flake-like thing, fine as frost on the ground.
Loko Vaisraele va swi vona, va vutisana va ku: I swilo muni leswi? hikuva a va nga tivi leswaku a swi ri swilo muni. Kutani Muxe a ku ka vona: Lebyi i vuswa lebyi mi nyikiwaka hi HOSI Xikwembu, lebyi mi nga ta dya byona.	When the people of Israel saw it, they said to one another, What is it? For they did not know what it was. And Moses said to them, It is the bread that the LORD has given you to eat.
HOSI Xikwembu xi lerisile leswaku un'wana ni un'wana a rholela leswi a nga ta dya swona, a swi hlengeletela ni hinkwavo lava nga ntsongeni wa yena, un'wana ni un'wana a kuma xintewana xin'we xa swona.	This is what the LORD has commanded: 'Gather of it, each one of you, as much as he can eat. You shall each take an omer, according to the number of the persons that each of you has in his tent.'
Kutani Vaisraele va ya swi hlengeleta; van'wana va hlengeleta swo tala, van'wana switsongo.	And the people of Israel did so. They gathered, some more, some less.
Kambe loko va swi pima hi xintewana, va kuma leswaku lava nga hlengeleta swo tala, a va nga ri na leswi tlulaka mpimo, ni lava nga hlengeleta switsongo, a va nga kayivelanga; un'wana ni un'wana a a hlengeletile leswi a nga kotaka ku dya a swi heta.	But when they measured it with an omer, whoever gathered much had nothing left over, and whoever gathered little had no lack. Each of them gathered as much as he could eat.
Kutani Muxe a ku ka vona: Ku nga tshuki ku va ni loyi a nga ta dya a siyela mundzuku.	And Moses said to them, Let no one leave any of it over till the morning.
Kambe a va n'wi yingisanga: Van'wana va dyile va siyela mundzuku, kutani leswi a swi sele swi huma swivungu swi nun'hwa; kutani Muxe a va holovela swinene.	But they did not listen to Moses. Some left part of it till the morning, and it bred worms and stank. And Moses was angry with them.
Masiku hinkwawo nimpundzu a va swi hlengeleta, un'wana ni un'wana a rholela leswi a nga ta kota ku dya a swi heta, kambe loko dyambu ri tlhava, a swi n'oka.	Morning by morning they gathered it, each as much as he could eat; but when the sun grew hot, it melted.
Hi siku ra vu-6, va hlengeleta swo ringana masiku mambirhi, munhu un'wana ni un'wana swintewana swimbirhi. Varhangeri hinkwavo va ntshungu va ya byela Muxe	On the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers each. And when all the leaders of the congregation came and told Moses
kutani yena a va hlamula a ku: HOSI Xikwembu xi lerisile sweswo xi te: ‘Mundzuku i siku ra Savata, ri nga siku ra ku wisa leri hlawuleriweke mina HOSI; katingani leswi mi lavaka ku swi katinga, mi sweka leswi mi lavaka ku swi sweka, kutani hinkwaswo leswi salaka, swi vekeni, mi swi hlayisela mundzuku.’ 	he said to them, This is what the LORD has commanded: 'Tomorrow is a day of solemn rest, a holy Sabbath to the LORD; bake what you will bake and boil what you will boil, and all that is left over lay aside to be kept till the morning.'
Kutani va swi veka va vekela siku leri tlhandlamaka, hilaha Muxe a va leriseke hakona; a swi onhakanga, naswona a swi humanga swivungu.	So they laid it aside till the morning, as Moses commanded them, and it did not stink, and there were no worms in it.
Kutani Muxe a ku ka vona: Namuntlha dyanani swona, hikuva i siku ra ku wisa ra Savata leri hlawuleriweke HOSI Xikwembu; namuntlha a mi nga kumi nchumu erivaleni.	Moses said, Eat it today, for today is a Sabbath to the LORD; today you will not find it in the field.
Mi fanele ku hlengeleta swakudya leswi hi masiku ya 6; hi siku ra vu-7, ri nga siku ra Savata, a swi nga vi kona.	Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day, which is a Sabbath, there will be none.
Hambiswiritano, hi siku leri ra vu-7, van'wana va huma va ya eku hlengeleteni, kambe a va kumanga nchumu.	On the seventh day some of the people went out to gather, but they found none.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe: Xana mi ta ala ku hlayisa swileriso ni milawu ya mina ku fikela rini xana?	And the LORD said to Moses, How long will you refuse to keep my commandments and my laws?
Twisisani leswaku mina HOSI ndzi mi nyikile siku ra ku wisa ra Savata; hikokwalaho, hi siku ra vu-6, ndzi mi nyika swakudya swa masiku mambirhi, kutani un'wana ni un'wana wa n'wina a a tshame lomu a nga kona, ku nga tshuki ku va ni loyi a humaka a ya ehandle, hi siku ra vu-7.	See! The LORD has given you the Sabbath; therefore on the sixth day he gives you bread for two days. Remain each of you in his place; let no one go out of his place on the seventh day.
Hikokwalaho, hi siku ra vu-7, vanhu a va wisa.	So the people rested on the seventh day.
Vaisraele va thya swakudya leswi evito ra manna; a swi ringana ni tindzhoho ta nhlampfurha, swi basile, swi nyanganya ku fana ni ximbhundzwa lexi totiweke vulombe.	Now the house of Israel called its name manna. It was like coriander seed, white, and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.
Kutani Muxe a ku: HOSI Xikwembu xi lerisile leswaku mi tata xintewana hi swakudya leswi, mi hlayisela vatukulu va n'wina hinkwavo, va ta vona swakudya leswi a ndzi mi phamela swona emananga, loko ndzi mi humesa etikweni ra Egipta.	Moses said, This is what the LORD has commanded: 'Let an omer of it be kept throughout your generations, so that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.'
Kutani Muxe a lerisa Aroni a ku: Teka xibya u chela xintewana xa manna eka xona, u ya xi veka emahlweni ka HOSI Xikwembu, u xi hlayisela vatukulu va n'wina hinkwavo.	And Moses said to Aaron, Take a jar, and put an omer of manna in it, and place it before the LORD to be kept throughout your generations.
Kutani Aroni a endla hilaha HOSI Xikwembu xi leriseke Muxe hakona, a veka xibya lexi emahlweni ka Areka ya Ntwanano leswaku xi hlayiseka.	As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron placed it before the testimony to be kept.
Vaisraele va dyile manna ku ringana malembe ya 40, ku kondza va ya fika etikweni leri a ri tshameka; va fikile endzilekaneni wa Kanana va ha dya manna.	The people of Israel ate the manna forty years, till they came to a habitable land. They ate the manna till they came to the border of the land of Canaan.
(Mpimo wa xintewana lowu vuriwaka omere wu nghena ka khume eka mpimo lowu vuriwaka efa.)	(An omer is the tenth part of an ephah.)
Kutani ntshungu hinkwawo wa Vaisraele wu ya emahlweni ni riendzo, wu suka emananga ya Sina; va famba mpfhuka lowu a va pimeriwile wona hi siku, hilaha HOSI Xikwembu a xi lerisile hakona, ku kondza va ya gova eRefidimi, kambe kona a ku nga ri na mati yo nwa.	All the congregation of the people of Israel moved on from the wilderness of Sin by stages, according to the commandment of the LORD, and camped at Rephidim, but there was no water for the people to drink.
Kutani va sungula ku holovela Muxe, va ku ka yena: Hi nyike mati hi nwa! Muxe a va hlamula a ku: Mi ndzi holovelela yini xana? Xana mi ringela yini HOSI Xikwembu xana?	Therefore the people quarreled with Moses and said, Give us water to drink. And Moses said to them, Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test the LORD?
Vanhu va khomiwa hi torha swinene kwale Refidimi, kutani va dzumadzumela Muxe, va ku ka yena: Xana u hi humesele yini etikweni ra Egipta, u ta hi lovisa hi torha, hina ni vana va hina ni swifuwo swa hina xana?	But the people thirsted there for water, and the people grumbled against Moses and said, Why did you bring us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our livestock with thirst?
Kutani Muxe a huwelela eka HOSI Xikwembu a ku: Xana ndzi ku yini hi vanhu lava xana? Va le kusuhi ni ku ndzi khandla hi maribye!	So Moses cried to the LORD, What shall I do with this people? They are almost ready to stone me.
Hiloko HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe: Hundzela emahlweni ka vanhu, u teka van'wana va vakulukumba va Israele, u rhanga na vona, u famba ni nhonga leyi u nga ba mati ya nambu hi yona.	And the LORD said to Moses, Pass on before the people, taking with you some of the elders of Israel, and take in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile, and go.
Vona, u ta ndzi kuma ndzi ku yimerile le ntshaveni ya Horebe kusuhi ni ribye; u ta fika u ba ribye, kutani ku ta huma mati lawa vanhu va nga ta nwa wona. Muxe a endla sweswo, vakulukumba va Israele va ri karhi va n'wi vona.	Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock at Horeb, and you shall strike the rock, and water shall come out of it, and the people will drink. And Moses did so, in the sight of the elders of Israel.
Kutani Muxe a thya ndhawu leyi evito ra Masa na Meriba, hileswaku: Ndzingo ni mholovo, hikuva Vaisraele a va n'wi holoverile kona, va ringa na HOSI Xikwembu hi ku vutisa va ku: Xana HOSI Xikwembu xi na hina, kumbe a xi na hina xana?	And he called the name of the place Massah and Meribah, because of the quarreling of the people of Israel, and because they tested the LORD by saying, Is the LORD among us or not?
Kutani Vaamaleke va ya va ya lwa ni Vaisraele, kwale Refidimi.	Then Amalek came and fought with Israel at Rephidim.
Kutani Muxe a byela Yoxuwa a ku: Hlawula vavanuna lava nga ta hi lwela, u huma nyimpi na vona mi ya lwa ni Vaamaleke; loko a ri mina, mundzuku ndzi ta ya yima enhlohlorhini ya ntshava ndzi khomile nhonga ya Xikwembu evokweni.	So Moses said to Joshua, Choose for us men, and go out and fight with Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the staff of God in my hand.
Kutani Yoxuwa a endla hilaha Muxe a n'wi leriseke hakona, a ya lwa ni Vaamaleke; Muxe na Aroni na Huru vona va tlhandluka va ya enhlohlorhini ya ntshava.	So Joshua did as Moses told him, and fought with Amalek, while Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.
X	Whenever Moses held up his hand, Israel prevailed, and whenever he lowered his hand, Amalek prevailed.
Ku fika laha mavoko ya Muxe ma karhalaka, kutani Aroni na Huru va teka ribye, va ri tikirheta leswaku a tshama ehenhla ka rona, kutani Aroni na Huru va tlakusela mavoko ya Muxe ehenhla, un'wana a yimile etlhelweni ra xinene, un'wana eka lera ximatsi; hi ndlela leyi, mavoko ya Muxe ma tshama ma tlakusiwile, dyambu ri kondza ri ya pela.	But Moses' hands grew weary, so they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat on it, while Aaron and Hur held up his hands, one on one side, and the other on the other side. So his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.
Kutani Yoxuwa a hlula Vaamaleke hi matlhari.	And Joshua overwhelmed Amalek and his people with the sword.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe: Vaamaleke, ndzi ta va herisela makumu emisaveni, ku nga sali na un'we loyi vanhu va nga ta va tsundzuka ha yena! Tsala marito lawa ebukwini, ma ta ka ma nga rivariwi, u ma hlayela na Yoxuwa.	Then the LORD said to Moses, Write this as a memorial in a book and recite it in the ears of Joshua, that I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven.
Kutani Muxe a aka alitari, a yi thya vito ra HOSI-i-mujeko-wanga	And Moses built an altar and called the name of it, The LORD Is My Banner
a ku: Leswi Vaamaleke va pfukeleke xiluvelo xa HOSI, nyimpi exikarhi ka vona na yona yi ta tlulela ni le ka vatukulu va vona hinkwavo.	saying, A hand upon the throne of the LORD! The LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.
Yetro muprista wa Midiyani loyi a a ri mukon'wana wa Muxe, a twa hinkwaswo leswi Xikwembu xi swi endleleke Muxe ni vanhu va xona va Israele, ni hilaha xi va humeseke hakona etikweni ra Egipta.	Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses and for Israel his people, how the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt.
Sipora nkata Muxe a a tshama eka tata wa yena Yetro, endzhaku ka loko Muxe a n'wi yisile kwale ka vona.	Now Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, had taken Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her home
Yetro a a amukerile ni vana va Sipora lava vambirhi. N'wana lowo sungula, Muxe a a n'wi thyile vito ra Gerixomu (hileswaku: Ndzi muluveri kwala), hikuva a a ku: Ndzi muluveri etikweni ra vanhu vambe.	along with her two sons. The name of the one was Gershom (for he said, I have been a sojourner in a foreign land)
Lowa vumbirhi, a a n'wi thyile vito ra Eliezere (hileswaku: Xikwembu xanga i mupfuni), hikuva a a ku: Xikwembu xa tatana, hi xona xi ndzi pfuneke, xi ndzi ponisa ku dlayiwa hi Faro.	and the name of the other, Eliezer (for he said, The God of my father was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh).
Kutani Yetro mukon'wana wa Muxe a ta ni vana va Muxe ni nsati wa yena emananga, laha Muxe a a govile kona entshaveni ya Xikwembu.	Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to Moses in the wilderness where he was encamped at the mountain of God.
A rhumela rito eka Muxe a ku: Mina Yetro mukon'wana wa wena, ndzi ta ka wena ndzi ri ni nsati wa wena ni vana va yena vambirhi.	And when he sent word to Moses, I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons with her,
Kutani Muxe a huma a ya hlanganisa mukon'wana wa yena; a fika a nkhinsama, kutani a n'wi ntswontswa. Loko va pfuxelanile, va ya nghena entsongeni.	Moses went out to meet his father-in-law and bowed down and kissed him. And they asked each other of their welfare and went into the tent.
Kutani Muxe a rungulela mukon'wana wa yena hinkwaswo leswi HOSI Xikwembu xi swi endleke eka Faro ni le ka Vaegipta, xi endlela ku pfuna Vaisraele; a n'wi rungulela ni ku tikeriwa hinkwako loku va nga va na kona endleleni, ni hilaha HOSI Xikwembu xi va poniseke hakona.	Then Moses told his father-in-law all that the LORD had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, all the hardship that had come upon them in the way, and how the LORD had delivered them.
Yetro a tsaka swinene, loko a twa mintirho leyinene leyi HOSI Xikwembu xi endleleke Vaisraele hi ku va kutsula emavokweni ya Vaegipta.	And Jethro rejoiced for all the good that the LORD had done to Israel, in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians.
X	Jethro said, Blessed be the LORD, who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of Pharaoh and has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.
Sweswi ndza swi tiva leswaku HOSI Xikwembu xi tlula swikwembu hinkwaswo, hikuva xi ponisile Vaisraele eka Vaegipta lava a va va khomile hi tihanyi.	Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods, because in this affair they dealt arrogantly with the people.
Kutani Yetro mukon'wana wa Muxe a humesela HOSI Xikwembu magandzelo lama hisiwaka ni lama dyiwaka; Aroni ni vakulukumba va Israele hinkwavo va ta va ta dya swakudya na mukon'wana wa Muxe, egandzelweni ra HOSI Xikwembu.	And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, brought a burnt offering and sacrifices to God; and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat bread with Moses' father-in-law before God.
Siku leri tlhandlamaka, Muxe a tshama ehansi, a avanyisa milandzu ya vanhu; ku sukela nimpundzu ku kondza ri pela, vanhu va yima va rhendzerile Muxe.	The next day Moses sat to judge the people, and the people stood around Moses from morning till evening.
Loko Yetro mukon'wana wa Muxe a vona hinkwaswo leswi Muxe a a ri karhi a endlela vanhu swona, a n'wi vutisa a ku: Xana i ntirho muni lowu u endlelaka vanhu lava xana? Xana hikwalaho ka yini ku tshama wena ntsena ehansi, vanhu lavan'wana hinkwavo va yimile va ku rhendzerile, ku sukela nimixo ku fikela nimadyambu, xana?	When Moses' father-in-law saw all that he was doing for the people, he said, What is this that you are doing for the people? Why do you sit alone, and all the people stand around you from morning till evening?
Muxe a hlamula mukon'wana wa yena, a ku: Vanhu va ta va ta ndzi vutisa leswaku Xikwembu xi ri yini etimhakeni ta vona.	And Moses said to his father-in-law, Because the people come to me to inquire of God
Loko munhu ni muakelani wa yena va holovile, va ta eka mina, kutani mina ndzi va avanyisela mhaka ya vona, ndzi va hlamusela swileriso swa Xikwembu ni milawu ya xona.	when they have a dispute, they come to me and I decide between one person and another, and I make them know the statutes of God and his laws.
Kutani mukon'wana wa Muxe a ku: Matirhele ya wena a ma hetisekanga.	Moses' father-in-law said to him, What you are doing is not good.
Wena ni vanhu lava u nga na vona mi ta tidlaya hi mintirho; ndzhwalo lowu i wukulu ngopfu eka wena, u nga ka u nga wu koti u ri wexe.	You and the people with you will certainly wear yourselves out, for the thing is too heavy for you. You are not able to do it alone.
Sweswi, yingisa leswi ndzi ku byelaka swona; ndzi navela ku ku tsundzuxa, kutani Xikwembu a xi ve na wena! Wena u ta hamba u va muyimeri wa vanhu eka Xikwembu, u fikisa timhaka ta vona eka xona.	Now obey my voice; I will give you advice, and God be with you! You shall represent the people before God and bring their cases to God
Hi wena u nga ta va dyondzisa swileriso ni milawu, u va tivisa leswi va fanelaka ku hanyisa swona, ni leswi va fanelaka ku endla swona.	and you shall warn them about the statutes and the laws, and make them know the way in which they must walk and what they must do.
Tlhandlakambirhi, tihlawulele exikarhi ka vanhu hinkwavo vavanuna lava tiyeke, u va veka ku va varhangeri, va fambisa mintlawa ya vanhu va 1 000, van'wana ya 100, van'wana ya 50, van'wana ya 10. Vavanuna lava va fanele ku va lava xiximaka Xikwembu, lava tshembekeke, naswona lava nga ta ala ku xaviwa.	Moreover, look for able men from all the people, men who fear God, who are trustworthy and hate a bribe, and place such men over the people as chiefs of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens.
Kutani u tshika vavanuna lava va hamba va avanyisela vanhu timhaka ta vona. Mhaka yin'wana ni yin'wana leyikulu, va ta yi tisa eka wena, kambe letitsongo hinkwato va ta ti avanyisa vona; sweswo swi ta vevukisa mpingu wa wena, hikuva u ta rhwarisana na vona mpingu wa kona.	And let them judge the people at all times. Every great matter they shall bring to you, but any small matter they shall decide themselves. So it will be easier for you, and they will bear the burden with you.
Loko u endla tano, ni loko Xikwembu xi ku lerisisa xisweswo, u ta kota ku yisa ntirho emahlweni; naswona, vanhu lava hinkwavo va ta ya emakaya va rhulisiwile timbilu.	If you do this, God will direct you, you will be able to endure, and all this people also will go to their place in peace.
Muxe a amukela marito ya mukon'wana wa yena, a endla hinkwaswo leswi a n'wi tsundzuxeke swona.	So Moses listened to the voice of his father-in-law and did all that he had said.
Kutani Muxe a hlawula vavanuna lava tiyeke exikarhi ka Vaisraele hinkwavo, a va veka ku va varhangeri, va fambisa mintlawa ya vanhu va 1 000, kumbe 100, kumbe 50, kumbe 10.	Moses chose able men out of all Israel and made them heads over the people, chiefs of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens.
Vavanuna lava va hamba va avanyisela vanhu timhaka; timhaka leto tika, va ti tisa eka Muxe, kambe letitsongo hinkwato ti avanyisiwa hi vona.	And they judged the people at all times. Any hard case they brought to Moses, but any small matter they decided themselves.
Muxe a lelana ni mukon'wana wa yena, kutani Yetro a timukela karikwavo.	Then Moses let his father-in-law depart, and he went away to his own country.
Hi siku ra ku tshama ka n'hweti ya vunharhu endzhaku ka loko va humile etikweni ra Egipta, Vaisraele va fikile emananga ya Sinayi.	On the third new moon after the people of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt, on that day they came into the wilderness of Sinai.
Loko va nghena emananga ya Sinayi, a va ta va huma hi le Refidimi; kutani va fika va gova kwale mananga ya Sinayi, va dzima mintsonga ya vona ku langutana ni ntshava ya Sinayi.	They set out from Rephidim and came into the wilderness of Sinai, and they encamped in the wilderness. There Israel encamped before the mountain
Kutani Muxe a tlhandluka a ya eka Xikwembu entshaveni. HOSI Xikwembu xi huwelela xi ri entshaveni, xi ku ka Muxe: Byela Vaisraele, vona vatukulu va Yakobo, leswaku mina HOSI ndzi vurisa sweswo ndzi ri	while Moses went up to God. The LORD called to him out of the mountain, saying, Thus you shall say to the house of Jacob, and tell the people of Israel
‘Mi swi vonile hi n'wexe leswi ndzi swi endleke eka Vaegipta; mi vonile ni hilaha ndzi mi rhwaleke hakona ndzi mi tisa ka mina, ku fana ni gama leri rhwalaka mavondlo ya rona etimpapeni.	'You yourselves have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles' wings and brought you to myself.
Kutani ke, loko mi yingisa leswi ndzi vulaka swona, ni loko mi hlayisa ntwanano wa mina, hambileswi misava hinkwayo yi nga ya mina, n'wina mi ta va vanhu va mina va xiviri exikarhi ka vanhu va matiko hinkwawo.	Now therefore, if you will indeed obey my voice and keep my covenant, you shall be my treasured possession among all peoples, for all the earth is mine
Eka mina, mi ta va mfumo wa vaprista, mi va tiko leri hlawulekeke.’ Hi wona marito lawa u nga ta ma byela Vaisraele.	and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.' These are the words that you shall speak to the people of Israel.
Kutani Muxe a ya vitana vakulukumba va Israele, a andlala emahlweni ka vona marito hinkwawo lawa HOSI Xikwembu xi n'wi leriseke wona.	So Moses came and called the elders of the people and set before them all these words that the LORD had commanded him.
Kutani vanhu hinkwavo va hlamula hi nomo wun'we, va ku: Hinkwaswo leswi HOSI Xikwembu xi swi vuleke, hi ta swi endla. Kutani Muxe a yisa nhlamulo leyi eka HOSI Xikwembu.	All the people answered together and said, All that the LORD has spoken we will do. And Moses reported the words of the people to the LORD.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe: Famba u ya byela vanhu leswaku namuntlha ni mundzuku va tibasisela ku gandzela, va hlantswa ni swiambalo swa vona.	the LORD said to Moses, Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments
Mundlwana, ri nga ta va siku ra vunharhu, va fanele ku va va hetile, hikuva hi siku rero mina HOSI Xikwembu ndzi ta rhelela ndzi ta entshaveni ya Sinayi, vanhu hinkwavo va ri karhi va swi vona.	and be ready for the third day. For on the third day the LORD will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people.
U ta bela vanhu mindzilekana ku rhendzeleka ni ntshava, u ku ka vona: ‘Tivoneleni leswaku mi nga tshuki mi khandziya mi ya entshaveni; ni ku khumba laha yi helelaka kona, mi nga khumbi! Loyi a nga ta khumba ntshava, u ta dlayiwa.’	And you shall set limits for the people all around, saying, 'Take care not to go up into the mountain or touch the edge of it. Whoever touches the mountain shall be put to death.
Munhu wa kona a nge dlayiwi hi mavoko, kambe ú to khandliwa hi maribye, kumbe a tlhaviwa hi nseve, a fa; hambi i xiharhi kumbe munhu, ku hava ku pona! Kambe loko mhalamhala yi biwa nkarhi wo leha, van'wana va ta tlhandlukela entshaveni.	No hand shall touch him, but he shall be stoned or shot; whether beast or man, he shall not live.' When the trumpet sounds a long blast, they shall come up to the mountain.
Kutani Muxe a rhelela hi le ntshaveni a ya laha vanhu a va ri kona, a fika a va byela leswaku va tibasisela ku gandzela, va hlantswa ni swiambalo swa vona.	So Moses went down from the mountain to the people and consecrated the people; and they washed their garments.
A engeta a ku ka vona: Mundlwana, ri nga siku ra vunharhu, mi fanele ku va mi hetile, naswona mi nga tshuki mi etlela ni vasati va n'wina.	And he said to the people, Be ready for the third day; do not go near a woman.
Hi siku ra vunharhu nimpundzu, tilo ri baleka, ri hatima-hatima, papa lero dziva ri khubumeta ntshava, mhalamhala yi ri karhi yi ba swinene, vanhu lava a va ri emintsongeni va rhurhumela hi ku chava.	On the morning of the third day there were thunders and lightnings and a thick cloud on the mountain and a very loud trumpet blast, so that all the people in the camp trembled.
Kutani Muxe a vitana vanhu leswaku va huma emintsongeni, va ya hlangana na Xikwembu; vanhu va fika va yima ehansi ka ntshava.	Then Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God, and they took their stand at the foot of the mountain.
Ntshava hinkwayo ya Sinayi a yi funengetiwile hi musi, hikuva Xikwembu a xi rhelerile xi ta ehenhla ka yona hi xivumbeko xa ndzilo. Kutani musi wa ndzilo lowu wu huma wu ya ehenhla ku fana ni ndzilo wa le xitikweni, ntshava hinkwayo yi tsekatseka swinene.	Now Mount Sinai was wrapped in smoke because the LORD had descended on it in fire. The smoke of it went up like the smoke of a kiln, and the whole mountain trembled greatly.
Mhalamhala yi ya yi ba swinene. Muxe a vulavula na Xikwembu, kutani xona xi n'wi hlamula hi rito leri tlakukeke.	And as the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him in thunder.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi rhelela xi ta enhlohlorhini ya ntshava ya Sinayi; xi vitanela Muxe enhlohlorhini ya ntshava, kutani Muxe a tlhandluka a ya kona.	The LORD came down on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain. And the LORD called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.
HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe: Rhelela u ya tshinya vanhu, hikuva va nga tshuka va tsemakanya ndzilekana, va ku va ta va ta vona HOSI Xikwembu, kutani ku nga fa lavo tala exikarhi ka vona.	And the LORD said to Moses, Go down and warn the people, lest they break through to the LORD to look and many of them perish.
Hambi va ri vaprista lava pfumeleriwaka ku tshinela kusuhi na mina HOSI, va fanele ku tibasisa; loko swi nga ri tano, ndzi ta va hlundzukela ndzi va ba.	Also let the priests who come near to the LORD consecrate themselves, lest the LORD break out against them.
Kutani Muxe a ku ka HOSI Xikwembu: Vanhu va nga ka va nga khandziyi laha ntshaveni ya Sinayi, hikuva hi wena u hi leriseke leswaku hi ba ndzilekana ku rhendzeleka ni ntshava, hi tlhela hi hlawulekisa ntshava leyi.	And Moses said to the LORD, The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai, for you yourself warned us, saying, 'Set limits around the mountain and consecrate it.'
HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe: Rhelela u ya vuya na Aroni; kambe u nga tshuki u pfumelela vaprista ni vanhu leswaku va tsemakanya ndzilekana va tlhandlukela eka mina HOSI Xikwembu, hikuva loko va endla sweswo, ndzi ta va hlundzukela ndzi va ba.	And the LORD said to him, Go down, and come up bringing Aaron with you. But do not let the priests and the people break through to come up to the LORD, lest he break out against them.
Kutani Muxe a rhelela a ya laha vanhu a va ri kona, a fika a va byela.	So Moses went down to the people and told them.
Kutani Xikwembu xi vula marito lawa hinkwawo, xi ku	And God spoke all these words, saying
Hi mina HOSI Xikwembu xa wena, lexi xi ku humeseke etikweni ra Egipta, ni le vuhlongeni bya kona.	I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.
U nga tshuki u gandzela swikwembu swin'wana, kambe gandzela mina ntsena.	You shall have no other gods before me.
U nga tshuki u tivatlela xifaniso xa xikwembu, kumbe xifaniso xa swilo swihi ni swihi leswi nga henhla etilweni kumbe leswi nga hansi emisaveni, kumbe leswi nga matini ehansi ka misava	You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.
u nga tshuki u swi nkhinsamela, kumbe ku swi tirhela, hikuva mina HOSI Xikwembu xa wena, ndzi Xikwembu xa rilaveta: Ndzi ba lava va ndzi vengaka kun'we ni vana va vona, ku fika eka rixaka ra vona ra vunharhu ni ra vumune.	You shall not bow down to them or serve them, for I the LORD your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and the fourth generation of those who hate me
Kambe ndzi komba rirhandzu ra mina leri tshembekaka ku fika eka rixaka ra madzana-dzana ra lava va ndzi rhandzaka, lava hlayisaka milawu ya mina.	but showing steadfast love to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments.
U nga tshuki u tlanga hi vito ra mina, hikuva mina HOSI Xikwembu xa wena ndzi nga ka ndzi nga tshiki ku ba loyi a tlangaka hi vito ra mina.	You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain, for the LORD will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain.
Tsundzuka ku hlayisa siku ra Savata, ri tshama ri hlawulekile.	Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.
U na masiku ya 6 lawa u faneleke ku tirha mintirho ya wena hinkwayo.	Six days you shall labor, and do all your work
Kambe siku ra vu-7 i siku ra ku wisa, leri hlawuleriweke mina HOSI Xikwembu xa wena; hi siku leri, u nga tshuki u tirha ntirho ni wun'we, wena kumbe n'wana wa wena wa xinuna ni wa xisati, kumbe nandza wa wena wa xinuna ni wa xisati, hambi xifuwo xa wena, kumbe munhu loyi a luveleke eka wena	but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God. On it you shall not do any work, you, or your son, or your daughter, your male servant, or your female servant, or your livestock, or the sojourner who is within your gates.
hikuva hi masiku ya 6, mina HOSI Xikwembu ndzi endlile tilo ni misava ni lwandle, ni hinkwaswo leswi nga ka swona, kutani hi siku ra vu-7 ndzi wisile; hikokwalaho, mina HOSI ndzi katekisile siku leri, ndzi ri endla leri hlawulekeke.	For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day. Therefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.
Xixima tata wa wena ni mana wa wena, leswaku u ta hanya masiku layo tala etikweni leri mina HOSI Xikwembu xa wena ndzi ku nyikaka rona.	Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the land that the LORD your God is giving you.
U nga tshuki u dlaya.	You shall not murder.
U nga tshuki u oswa.	You shall not commit adultery.
U nga tshuki u yiva.	You shall not steal.
U nga tshuki u lumbeta munhu-kuloni hi vumbhoni byo hemba.	You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.
U nga tshuki u navela yindlu ya munhu-kuloni, hambi a ri nsati wa yena, u nga n'wi naveli; ni nandza wa yena wa xinuna kumbe wa xisati, ni homu ya yena, ni mbhongolo ya yena, kumbe xilo xihi ni xihi lexi nga xa yena, u nga tshuki u xi navela.	You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or his male servant, or his female servant, or his ox, or his donkey, or anything that is your neighbor's.
Loko Vaisraele hinkwavo va twa ku baleka ka tilo ni ku ba ka mhalamhala, ni loko va vona ku vangama ka rihati ni musi lowu mbulukaka entshaveni, va yimela kule va ri karhi va rhurhumela.	Now when all the people saw the thunder and the flashes of lightning and the sound of the trumpet and the mountain smoking, the people were afraid and trembled, and they stood far off
Kutani va ku ka Muxe: Vulavula na hina wena, hi ta yingisa, kambe xi nga vi Xikwembu lexi vulavulaka na hina, hikuva hi nga fa!	and said to Moses, You speak to us, and we will listen; but do not let God speak to us, lest we die.
Kutani Muxe a hlamula Vaisraele, a ku: Mi nga chavi! Xikwembu xi tile ku ta mi kambela, mi ta hamba mi va ni xichavo eka xona, mi nga ha dyohi.	Moses said to the people, Do not fear, for God has come to test you, that the fear of him may be before you, that you may not sin.
Kutani Vaisraele va sala va yimile kule, Muxe yena a tshinela kusuhi ni papa ra ntima leri Xikwembu a xi ri endzeni ka rona.	The people stood far off, while Moses drew near to the thick darkness where God was.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi lerisa Muxe ku fikisa marito ya xona eka Vaisraele lama nge: Mi swi vonile hi n'wexe hilaha ndzi vulavuleke hakona na n'wina ndzi ri etilweni.	And the LORD said to Moses, Thus you shall say to the people of Israel: 'You have seen for yourselves that I have talked with you from heaven.
Mi nga tshuki mi tiendlela swikwembu swin'wana, hikuva ndzi kona mina; mi nga tshuki mi tiendlela swikwembu hi silivhere ni nsuku.	You shall not make gods of silver to be with me, nor shall you make for yourselves gods of gold.
Mi ta ndzi akela alitari hi misava, kutani mi ndzi humesela magandzelo ya n'wina lama hisiwaka ni ya xinakulobye ehenhla ka yona, mi tlhavela eka yona swifuwo swa n'wina leswikulu ni leswitsongo. Etindhawini hinkwato leti ndzi ti hlawuleke leswaku mi ndzi gandzela eka tona, ndzi ta ta eka n'wina, ndzi ta mi katekisa.	An altar of earth you shall make for me and sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings, your sheep and your oxen. In every place where I cause my name to be remembered I will come to you and bless you.
Loko mi ndzi akela alitari hi maribye, mi nga tshuki mi aka hi maribye lama vatliweke, hikuva loko mi yi aka hi ku tirhisa mbatlo, ma yi nyamisa.	If you make me an altar of stone, you shall not build it of hewn stones, for if you wield your tool on it you profane it.
Naswona mi nga khandziyi alitarini hi swikhandziyo, hikuva vuhava bya n'wina byi nga vonaka.	And you shall not go up by steps to my altar, that your nakedness be not exposed on it.'
Milawu leyi u nga ta vekela Vaisraele, hi leyi	Now these are the rules that you shall set before them.
Loko u xava Muheveru ku va hlonga ra wena, ú ta tirha malembe ya 6, kutani hi lembe ra vu-7, n'wi ntshunxe a tifambela, a nga hakelanga nchumu.	When you buy a Hebrew slave, he shall serve six years, and in the seventh he shall go out free, for nothing.
Loko a tile ka wena a nga ri na nsati, a a fambe a ri yexe. Loko a tile a ri ni nsati, a a fambe na yena.	If he comes in single, he shall go out single; if he comes in married, then his wife shall go out with him.
Loko n'wini wa hlonga a ri tekisa nsati, kutani nsati loyi a veleka vana va xinuna ni va xisati, siku hlonga ri fambaka, ri ta famba ri ri roxe, nsati wa rona ni vana va ta sala eka n'wini wa vona.	If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out alone.
Kambe loko hlonga ri ku: ‘Ndzi tsakela n'wini wa mina, ndzi rhandza ni nsati wa mina ni vana va mina, a ndzi lavi ku ntshunxiwa ndzi suka ndzi famba’	But if the slave plainly says, 'I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free,'
n'wini wa rona ú ta ya na rona eka Xikwembu, a ri yimisa ri khegetela rivanti kumbe rimba ra rona, a ri boxa ndleve kwalaho hi ntlhavo; kutani ri ta va hlonga vutomi hinkwabyo.	then his master shall bring him to God, and he shall bring him to the door or the doorpost. And his master shall bore his ear through with an awl, and he shall be his slave forever.
Loko munhu a xavisa n'wana wa yena wa xisati ku va hlonga, n'wana loyi a nga ha ntshunxiwi ku fana ni mahlonga ya xinuna.	When a man sells his daughter as a slave, she shall not go out as the male slaves do.
Loko muxavi a n'wi xavela ku va nsati wa yena, kutani muxavi loyi a nga ha tsakisiwi hi yena, a a n'wi pfumelele ku kutsuriwa, a nga tshuki a n'wi xavisela vanhu van'wana, hikuva ú hoxerile nsati loyi ngopfu.	If she does not please her master, who has designated her for himself, then he shall let her be redeemed. He shall have no right to sell her to a foreign people, since he has broken faith with her.
Kambe loko a n'wi xavela ku va nsati wa n'wana wa yena wa xinuna, ú ta n'wi hlayisa ku fana ni vana va yena va xisati.	If he designates her for his son, he shall deal with her as with a daughter.
Loko wanuna loyi a teka nsati un'wana, ú ta ya emahlweni a hlayisa loyi wa hlonga a n'wi nyika swakudya ni swiambalo ni tifanelo hinkwato ta vukati.	If he takes another wife to himself, he shall not diminish her food, her clothing, or her marital rights.
Loko a n'wi tsona swilo leswinharhu leswi, wansati ú ta suka a famba, a nga kutsuriwanga hi mali.	And if he does not do these three things for her, she shall go out for nothing, without payment of money.
Munhu un'wana ni un'wana loyi a nga ta ba un'wana a n'wi dlaya, ú ta dlayiwa.	Whoever strikes a man so that he dies shall be put to death.
Kasi loko a nga n'wi jumanga, kambe a ri mina Xikwembu ndzi nga n'wi nyiketa leswaku a dlayiwa, ndzi ta komba mudlayi lomu a nga ta tumbela kona.	But if he did not lie in wait for him, but God let him fall into his hand, then I will appoint for you a place to which he may flee.
Kambe munhu loyi a yelaka un'wana a ri ni makungu ya ku n'wi dlaya hi tihanyi, hambiloko a tumberile alitarini ya mina, ú fanele ku susiwa kona leswaku a ya dlayiwa.	But if a man willfully attacks another to kill him by cunning, you shall take him from my altar, that he may die.
Un'wana ni un'wana loyi a baka tata wa yena kumbe mana wa yena, ú ta dlayiwa.	Whoever strikes his father or his mother shall be put to death.
Un'wana ni un'wana loyi a yivaka munhu, a n'wi xavisa, kumbe a tshama na yena, ú ta dlayiwa.	Whoever steals a man and sells him, and anyone found in possession of him, shall be put to death.
Un'wana ni un'wana loyi a rhuketelaka tata wa yena kumbe mana wa yena, ú ta dlayiwa.	Whoever curses his father or his mother shall be put to death.
Loko vanhu va holova, kutani un'wana a ba loyi un'wana hi ribye kumbe hi xibakela, la biweke a kala a vabya kambe a nga fi	When men quarrel and one strikes the other with a stone or with his fist and the man does not die but takes to his bed
a kota ku pfuka emasangwini a famba-famba ehandle a xongotela, loyi a nga n'wi ba ú ta va a humile enandzwini; ntsena ú ta riha, hikuva ú n'wi tsandzekisile ku tirha, kutani ú ta tlhela a humesa swa ku n'wi tshungurisa.	then if the man rises again and walks outdoors with his staff, he who struck him shall be clear; only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall have him thoroughly healed.
Loko munhu a ba hlonga ra yena ra xinuna kumbe ra xisati hi nhonga, kutani hlonga ri fela kwalaho, munhu loyi ú fanele ku riha.	When a man strikes his slave, male or female, with a rod and the slave dies under his hand, he shall be avenged.
Kambe loko hlonga ri kota ku hanya siku rin'we kumbe mambirhi ri nga si fa, rifu ra rona a ri fanelanga ku rihiwa, hikuva n'wini wa rona ú lahlekeriwile hi xuma xa yena.	But if the slave survives a day or two, he is not to be avenged, for the slave is his money.
Loko vanhu va lwa, kutani va ya tlumba wansati loyi a tikeke, va n'wi vangela ku onhakeriwa kambe a nga vavisekanga kun'wana, loyi a n'wi tlumbeke ú ta riha leswi n'wini wa nsati a nga ta lava swona hi ku landza mpimo lowu vekiweke hi vaavanyisi.	When men strive together and hit a pregnant woman, so that her children come out, but there is no harm, the one who hit her shall surely be fined, as the woman's husband shall impose on him, and he shall pay as the judges determine.
Kambe loko wansati a tshuka a vavisiwile, loyi a nga n'wi vavisa ú ta riha hi ndlela leyi: Vutomi hi vutomi	But if there is harm, then you shall pay life for life
tihlo hi tihlo, tino hi tino, voko hi voko, nenge hi nenge	eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot
ku tshwa hi ku tshwa, mbanga hi mbanga, felangati hi felangati.	burn for burn, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.
Loko munhu a ba hlonga ra yena ra xinuna kumbe ra xisati a ri dlaya tihlo, ú fanele ku ntshunxa hlonga leri ri tifambela, hi mhaka ya tihlo leri.	When a man strikes the eye of his slave, male or female, and destroys it, he shall let the slave go free because of his eye.
Loko a ba hlonga ra yena ra xinuna kumbe ra xisati a ri gula tino, ú fanele ku ri ntshunxa ri tifambela, hi mhaka ya tino leri.	If he knocks out the tooth of his slave, male or female, he shall let the slave go free because of his tooth.
Loko homu yi tlhava wanuna kumbe wansati yi n'wi dlaya, yi fanele ku khandliwa hi maribye yi fa, nyama ya yona yi nga dyiwi; kambe n'wini wa yona ú ta va a nga ri na nandzu.	When an ox gores a man or a woman to death, the ox shall be stoned, and its flesh shall not be eaten, but the owner of the ox shall not be liable.
Kambe homu leyi tshameke yi tlhava vanhu, kutani n'wini wa yona a tsundzuxiwa kambe a nga yi pfaleli etshangeni, loko yi dlaya wanuna kumbe wansati, yi fanele ku khandliwa hi maribye yi fa, n'wini wa yona na yena ú faneriwile hi rifu.	But if the ox has been accustomed to gore in the past, and its owner has been warned but has not kept it in, and it kills a man or a woman, the ox shall be stoned, and its owner also shall be put to death.
Kambe loko n'wini wa homu a tshuka a lerisiwile ku riha, ú fanele ku humesa hinkwaswo leswi a nga ta byeriwa ku kutsula vutomi bya yena ha swona.	If a ransom is imposed on him, then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatever is imposed on him.
Loko homu yi tlhava n'wana wa mufana kumbe wa nhwanyana wa munhu un'wana, ka ha ta tirha nawu wolowo eka n'wini wa yona.	If it gores a man's son or daughter, he shall be dealt with according to this same rule.
Loko homu yi tlhava hlonga ra xinuna kumbe ra xisati, n'wini wa yona ú ta nyika n'wini wa hlonga mali ya tisilivhere ta 30, homu yona yi khandliwa hi maribye yi fa.	If the ox gores a slave, male or female, the owner shall give to their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.
Loko munhu a tshika khele ri nga funengetiwanga, kumbe loko a cela khele a nga ri funengeti, kutani ku wela homu kumbe mbhongolo endzeni ka rona	When a man opens a pit, or when a man digs a pit and does not cover it, and an ox or a donkey falls into it
n'wini wa khele leri ú fanele ku riha xifuwo lexi feke; ú ta nyika n'wini wa xona emali, kambe xona xi ta va xa yena.	the owner of the pit shall make restoration. He shall give money to its owner, and the dead beast shall be his.
Loko homu ya munhu un'wana yi tlhava ya un'wana yi yi dlaya, vinyi va tona va ta xavisa homu leyi hanyaka kutani va avelana mali ya kona; hambi yi ri homu leyi nga fa, va fanele ku avanyiselana.	When one man's ox butts another's, so that it dies, then they shall sell the live ox and share its price, and the dead beast also they shall share.
Kambe loko swi tiveka leswaku homu leyi a yi tolovele ku tlhavetela tin'wana, kutani n'wini wa yona a nga yi pfaleli etshangeni, ú fanele ku riha homu hi ku humesa yin'wana, yena a teka leyi yi nga fa.	Or if it is known that the ox has been accustomed to gore in the past, and its owner has not kept it in, he shall repay ox for ox, and the dead beast shall be his.
Loko munhu a yiva homu kumbe nyimpfu, kutani a yi dlaya kumbe a yi xavisa, homu ya kona ú ta yi riha hi ntlhanu wa tihomu, kasi nyimpfu yona ú ta yi riha hi mune wa tinyimpfu.	If a man steals an ox or a sheep, and kills it or sells it, he shall repay five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.
Loko khamba ri kumiwa ri ri karhi ri tshova yindlu nivusiku, kutani ri biwa ri fela kwalaho, rifu ra rona a ri rihiwi.	If a thief is found breaking in and is struck so that he dies, there shall be no bloodguilt for him
Kambe loko a dlayiwa ninhlekanhi, rifu ra yena ri fanele ku rihiwa.
Muyivi ú fanele ku humesa swo riha hinkwaswo. Loko a pfumala, ú fanele ku xavisiwa ku riha leswi a swi yiveke.	but if the sun has risen on him, there shall be bloodguilt for him. He shall surely pay. If he has nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.
Kambe loko xifuwo lexi yiviweke xi kumiwa eka khamba leri xa ha hanya, hambi yi ri homu kumbe mbhongolo kumbe nyimpfu, khamba ri ta humesa swifuwo swimbirhi ku riha xin'we.	If the stolen beast is found alive in his possession, whether it is an ox or a donkey or a sheep, he shall pay double.
Loko munhu a dyisa swifuwo swa yena ensin'wini ya yena ya mavele kumbe ya vhinya, kutani a swi tshika swi ya dya ni le nsin'wini ya un'wana, munhu loyi ú ta teka ntshovelo lowunene ensin'wini ya yena ya mavele kumbe ya vhinya, a ya riha hi wona.	If a man causes a field or vineyard to be grazed over, or lets his beast loose and it feeds in another man's field, he shall make restitution from the best in his own field and in his own vineyard.
Loko munhu a lumeka nhova, kutani ndzilo wu hangalaka wu ya hisa mavele lama fumbiweke kumbe lawa a ma nga si tshoveriwa ensin'wini, loyi a nga sungula ritshwa leri, ú fanele ku riha hinkwaswo leswi nga tshwa.	If fire breaks out and catches in thorns so that the stacked grain or the standing grain or the field is consumed, he who started the fire shall make full restitution.
Loko munhu a yisa mali kumbe nhundzu eka nakulobye leswaku a n'wi hlayisela swona, kutani swilo leswi swi yiviwa emutini wa kona, loyi a yiveke ú fanele ku riha kambirhi, loko a kumiwa.	If a man gives to his neighbor money or goods to keep safe, and it is stolen from the man's house, then, if the thief is found, he shall pay double.
Kambe loko khamba ri nga kumiwi, loyi a a hlayisa nhundzu ú fanele ku hlambanyisiwa emahlweni ka mina Xikwembu, a tiyisa leswaku a hi yena la nga yiva nhundzu ya nakulobye.	If the thief is not found, the owner of the house shall come near to God to show whether or not he has put his hand to his neighbor's property.
Loko vanhu vambirhi va lwetana hi xilo xihi ni xihi, ku fana ni homu, kumbe mbhongolo, kumbe nyimpfu, kumbe swiambalo, kumbe nchumu wihi ni wihi lowu lahlekeke, kutani un'wana a ku i swa yena, mhaka ya vanhu lavambirhi lava yi fanele ku tisiwa eka mina Xikwembu; loyi ndzi nga ta n'wi kuma a ri ni nandzu, ú ta rihela loyi un'wana kambirhi.	For every breach of trust, whether it is for an ox, for a donkey, for a sheep, for a cloak, or for any kind of lost thing, of which one says, 'This is it,' the case of both parties shall come before God. The one whom God condemns shall pay double to his neighbor.
Loko munhu a ya fuyisa homu kumbe mbhongolo kumbe nyimpfu kumbe xifuwo xihi ni xihi eka nakulobye, kutani xi fa, kumbe xi vaviseka, kumbe xi phanghiwa hi valala, ku ri hava loyi a swi voneke hi mahlo	If a man gives to his neighbor a donkey or an ox or a sheep or any beast to keep safe, and it dies or is injured or is driven away, without anyone seeing it
mhaka ya vona yi ta tsemiwa hi ku hlambanya emahlweni ka mina HOSI Xikwembu, ku tiyisa leswaku loyi a a fuyisiwile xifuwo a nga xi khumbanga, kutani n'wini wa xifuwo ú ta pfumela, a nga ka a nga rihisi mufuyisiwa.	an oath by the LORD shall be between them both to see whether or not he has put his hand to his neighbor's property. The owner shall accept the oath, and he shall not make restitution.
Kambe loko xifuwo xi lo yiviwa kunene, loyi a a fuyisiwile, ú fanele ku rihela n'wini wa xona.	But if it is stolen from him, he shall make restitution to its owner.
Loko xifuwo xi handzuleriwile hi swiharhi swa nhova, loyi a a fuyisiwile a a xi tise xi ta voniwa leswaku xi handzuleriwile, kutani a nga ka a nga rihisiwi.	If it is torn by beasts, let him bring it as evidence. He shall not make restitution for what has been torn.
Loko munhu a lomba xifuwo eka nakulobye, kutani xifuwo lexi xi vavisiwa kumbe xi fa, n'wini wa xona a nga ri kona, loyi a lombeke xona ú fanele ku riha.	If a man borrows anything of his neighbor, and it is injured or dies, the owner not being with it, he shall make full restitution.
Kambe loko n'wini wa xona a ri kona loko swi humelela, loyi a lombeke a nga fanelanga ku riha. Loko xifuwo a xi lombiwile hi mali, mali ya kona hi yona yi rihaka.	If the owner was with it, he shall not make restitution; if it was hired, it came for its hiring fee.
Loko wanuna a kanganyisa nhwanyana loyi a nga si tivanaka ni wanuna, a etlela na yena, ú fanele ku humesa xuma a n'wi lovola a va nsati wa yena.	If a man seduces a virgin who is not betrothed and lies with her, he shall give the bride-price for her and make her his wife.
Kambe loko tata wa nhwanyana a ala leswaku n'wana wa yena a tekiwa hi munhu loyi, wanuna wa kona ú fanele ku riha hi mali leyi ringanaka ntsengo lowu lovolaka nhwana loyi a nga si tivanaka ni wanuna.	If her father utterly refuses to give her to him, he shall pay money equal to the bride-price for virgins.
Mi nga tsetseleli vanyamusoro, va dlayeni.	You shall not permit a sorceress to live.
Un'wana ni un'wana loyi a etlelaka ni xifuwo ú fanele ku herisiwa.	Whoever lies with an animal shall be put to death.
Un'wana ni un'wana loyi a humeselaka swikwembu swin'wana emagandzelo, ematshan'wini ya ku gandzela mina HOSI ntsena, ú fanele ku herisiwa.	Whoever sacrifices to any god, other than the LORD alone, shall be devoted to destruction.
Mi nga tshuki mi khoma valuveri hi tihanyi kumbe ku va xanisa, hikuva na n'wina mi vile valuveri etikweni ra Egipta.	You shall not wrong a sojourner or oppress him, for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt.
Mi nga tshuki mi xanisa noni kumbe n'wana loyi a nga feriwa hi vatswari.	You shall not mistreat any widow or fatherless child.
Loko mo va xanisa, kutani va ta va ta rila eka mina, ku rila ka vona ndzi ta ku twa hakunene	If you do mistreat them, and they cry out to me, I will surely hear their cry
kutani ndzi ta pfurha hi ku hlundzuka, ndzi mi vangela tinyimpi leswaku mi dlayiwa, vasati va n'wina va ta hundzuka tinoni, vana va n'wina va sala va nga ha ri na vatatana.	and my wrath will burn, and I will kill you with the sword, and your wives shall become widows and your children fatherless.
Loko mi lomba un'wana wa vanhu va mina loyi mi nga na yena wa xisiwana emali, mi nga tshuki mi n'wi sala ndzhaku kukota lava bindzulaka hi ku lombisa mali, naswona mi nga lavi ntswalo wa mali leyi mi yi lombeke xisiwana lexi.	If you lend money to any of my people with you who is poor, you shall not be like a moneylender to him, and you shall not exact interest from him.
Loko u tshuka u tekile xiambalo xa nakuloni loyi a nga ni nandzu eka wena, u fanele ku n'wi tlherisela xona dyambu ri nga si pela	If ever you take your neighbor's cloak in pledge, you shall return it to him before the sun goes down
hikuva hi wona nkumba wa yena, ú sirhelela miri wa yena ha yona; xana ku nga va ni xin'wana lexi a etlelaka a funengerile xona xana? Loko a ta a ta rila eka mina, ku rila ka yena ndzi ta ku twa, hikuva mina ndzi twela vanhu vusiwana.	for that is his only covering, and it is his cloak for his body; in what else shall he sleep? And if he cries to me, I will hear, for I am compassionate.
Mi nga tshuki mi ndzi sandza mina Xikwembu, kumbe ku rhuketela murhangeri wa vanhu va ka n'wina.	You shall not revile God, nor curse a ruler of your people.
Mi nga tshuki mi hlwela ku humesa nhlengo wa ntshovelo wa n'wina wa mavele ni wa vhinyo ni mafurha.
Vana va n'wina va xinuna va mativula, mi fanele ku ndzi nyiketa vona.	You shall not delay to offer from the fullness of your harvest and from the outflow of your presses. The firstborn of your sons you shall give to me.
Mi ta endlisa sweswo ni le ka tihomu ta n'wina ni tinyimpfu ta n'wina: Xifuwo xa mativula xi fanele ku tshama ni mana wa xona masiku ya 7; kambe hi siku ra vu-8 mi ta ndzi tisela xona.	You shall do the same with your oxen and with your sheep: seven days it shall be with its mother; on the eighth day you shall give it to me.
Mi ta va vanhu lava hlawuleriweke mina, hikokwalaho mi nga tshuki mi dya nyama ya xifuwo lexi handzuleriweke hi swiharhi enhoveni; xifuwo xo tano, xi nyikeni timbyana.	You shall be consecrated to me. Therefore you shall not eat any flesh that is torn by beasts in the field; you shall throw it to the dogs.
Mi nga tshuki mi hangalasa timhaka leti nga riki na vumbhoni. Mi nga tshuki mi humesa vumbhoni byo hemba hi ku yima ni munhu wo homboloka ehubyeni.	You shall not spread a false report. You shall not join hands with a wicked man to be a malicious witness.
Mi nga tshuki mi endla leswo biha hi ku landzelela vunyingi; naswona, loko mi nyika vumbhoni ehubyeni, mi nga tshuki mi yima ni lavo tala, loko va tshika ku endla leswi lulameke.	You shall not fall in with the many to do evil, nor shall you bear witness in a lawsuit, siding with the many, so as to pervert justice
Nakambe, mi nga tshuki mi yimelela munhu ehubyeni, hambiloko a ri xisiwana.	nor shall you be partial to a poor man in his lawsuit.
Loko u tshuka u hlangana ni homu leyi lahlekeke ya nala wa wena, kumbe mbhongolo ya yena, yi khayime u n'wi yisela yona.	If you meet your enemy's ox or his donkey going astray, you shall bring it back to him.
Loko u vona munhu loyi a ku vengaka a ri ni mbhongolo leyi weke ni ndzwalo, u nga n'wi tshiki na yona, n'wi pfune ku yi pfuxa.	If you see the donkey of one who hates you lying down under its burden, you shall refrain from leaving him with it; you shall rescue it with him.
Mi nga tshiki ku avanyisa timhaka hi ku lulama ehubyeni, hambi ta xisiwana xa ka n'wina.	You shall not pervert the justice due to your poor in his lawsuit.
Chavani ku lumbeta van'wana, naswona mi nga tshuki mi dlaya loyi a nga riki na nandzu kumbe loyi a lulameke, hikuva ndzi nga ka ndzi nga tshiki nandzu wa lava endlaka vubihi byo tano.	Keep far from a false charge, and do not kill the innocent and righteous, for I will not acquit the wicked.
Mi nga tshuki mi pfumela ku xaviwa, hikuva swi dlaya mahlo ya lava vekiweke ku avanyisa timhaka, kutani va gombonyokisa ta vanhu lava vulavulaka ntiyiso.	And you shall take no bribe, for a bribe blinds the clear-sighted and subverts the cause of those who are in the right.
Mi nga tshuki mi xanisa muluveri, hikuva na n'wina mi vile valuveri etikweni ra Egipta, kutani ma swi tiva leswi ku va muluveri swi nga xiswona.	You shall not oppress a sojourner. You know the heart of a sojourner, for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt.
Mi ta rima masimu ya n'wina malembe ya 6, mi hlengeleta ntshovelo wa kona	For six years you shall sow your land and gather in its yield
kambe hi lembe ra vu-7, mi fanele ku ma wisisa, mi ma tshika ma hundzuka mafusi. Leswi swi nga ta mila hi lembe leri ra vu-7 swi ta va swakudya swa swisiwana; leswi nga ta siyiwa hi swisiwana, swi ta dyiwa hi swiharhi swa nhova. Mi ta endlisa sweswo ni le ka masimu ya n'wina ya vhinya ni mintanga ya n'wina ya mitlhwari.	but the seventh year you shall let it rest and lie fallow, that the poor of your people may eat; and what they leave the beasts of the field may eat. You shall do likewise with your vineyard, and with your olive orchard.
Mi ni masiku ya 6 lawa mi faneleke ku endla mintirho ya n'wina hinkwayo ha wona; kambe hi siku ra vu-7, mi wisa; tihomu ta n'wina ni timbhongolo ta n'wina ti ta wisa na tona; hambi va ri vana va mahlonga ya n'wina ya xisati, ni valuveri, va ta kuma ku hefemula na vona.	Six days you shall do your work, but on the seventh day you shall rest; that your ox and your donkey may have rest, and the son of your servant woman, and the alien, may be refreshed.
Tivoneleni leswaku mi endla hinkwaswo leswi ndzi mi byeleke swona. Naswona, mi nga tshuki mi kumbuka swikwembu swin'wana, mi nga vulavuli hi swona.	Pay attention to all that I have said to you, and make no mention of the names of other gods, nor let it be heard on your lips.
Mi fanele ku ndzi tlangela hi minkhuvo minharhu elembeni.	Three times in the year you shall keep a feast to me.
Mi ta endla Nkhuvo wa Xinkwa lexo-ke-comela; hilaha ndzi mi leriseke hakona, mi fanele ku dya xinkwa lexo-ke-comela masiku ya 7 enkarhini lowu vekiweke wa n'hweti ya Abibi, hikuva hi yona n'hweti leyi mi humeke ha yona etikweni ra Egipta. Ku nga vi na munhu loyi a taka emahlweni ka mina a nga tamelanga nchumu.	You shall keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread. As I commanded you, you shall eat unleavened bread for seven days at the appointed time in the month of Abib, for in it you came out of Egypt. None shall appear before me empty-handed.
Mi ta endla Nkhuvo wa Ntshovelo, mi humesa mihandzu yo sungula ya nyuku wa n'wina eka leswi mi swi byaleke emasin'wini. Eku heleni ka nkarhi wa ntshovelo, mi ta endla Nkhuvo wo Hlengeleta, mi hlengeleta swa nyuku wa n'wina leswi mi swi tshoveleke emasin'wini.	You shall keep the Feast of Harvest, of the firstfruits of your labor, of what you sow in the field. You shall keep the Feast of Ingathering at the end of the year, when you gather in from the field the fruit of your labor.
Elembeni, vavanuna va ka n'wina hinkwavo va fanele ku hlengeletana kanharhu emahlweni ka mina HOSI N'wini wa vona.	Three times in the year shall all your males appear before the Lord GOD.
Mi nga tshuki mi katsa ngati ya swifuwo ni xinkwa lexi nga ni comela, loko mi ndzi gandzela; naswona, mi nga tshiki mafurha ya swona ma tshama ku fikela nimpundzu, loko mi ndzi endlela nkhuvo.	You shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with anything leavened, or let the fat of my feast remain until the morning.
Vonani, ndzi mi rhumela ntsumi leyi nga ta mi rhangela; yi ta mi sirhelela eriendzweni ra n'wina, yi ya mi fikisa endhawini leyi ndzi yi lulamiseke.	Behold, I send an angel before you to guard you on the way and to bring you to the place that I have prepared.
Yingisani ntsumi leyi, mi endla leswi yi nga ta swi vula; mi nga tshuki mi ala swileriso swa yona, hikuva yi nga ka yi nga mi tsetseleli loko mi tiarisa, naswona yi tirha hi vito ra mina.	Pay careful attention to him and obey his voice; do not rebel against him, for he will not pardon your transgression, for my name is in him.
Kambe loko mi yingisa swinene marito ya ntsumi, mi endla hinkwaswo leswi ndzi nga ta swi vula, ndzi ta va nala wa valala va n'wina, ndzi lwa ni lava nga ta lwa na n'wina.	But if you carefully obey his voice and do all that I say, then I will be an enemy to your enemies and an adversary to your adversaries.
Ntsumi ya mina yi ta rhanga emahlweni ka n'wina, yi ya mi fikisa eka Vaamori, ni Vahiti, ni Vaperesi, ni Vakanana ni Vahivhi, ni Vayebusi, kutani ndzi ta nyamalarisa vanhu lava.	When my angel goes before you and brings you to the Amorites and the Hittites and the Perizzites and the Canaanites, the Hivites and the Jebusites, and I blot them out
Hikokwalaho, mi nga tshuki mi nkhinsamela swikwembu swa vona, kumbe ku swi humesela magandzelo, naswona mi nga tshuki mi landza mikhuva ya vona, kambe herisani swikwembu swa kona, mi fayetela ni maribye ya vukhongeri bya vona bya hava.	you shall not bow down to their gods nor serve them, nor do as they do, but you shall utterly overthrow them and break their pillars in pieces.
Mi ta tirhela mina HOSI Xikwembu xa n'wina ntsena, kutani ndzi ta mi katekisa hi ku mi nyika vuswa ni mati; ndzi ta susa ni mavabyi exikarhi ka n'wina.	You shall serve the LORD your God, and he will bless your bread and your water, and I will take sickness away from among you.
Etikweni ra n'wina, a ku nga vi na wansati loyi a nga ta onhakeriwa, kumbe loyi a nga ta ka a nga veleki; naswona a ndzi nga hunguti ntsengo wa masiku ya vutomi bya n'wina.	None shall miscarry or be barren in your land; I will fulfill the number of your days.
Ndzi ta chavisa vanhu emahlweni ka n'wina, ndzi hlanganisa tinhloko ta hinkwavo lava mi nga ta lwa na vona; valala va n'wina hinkwavo ndzi ta endla leswaku va mi komba swikosi va suka va tsutsuma.	I will send my terror before you and will throw into confusion all the people against whom you shall come, and I will make all your enemies turn their backs to you.
Ndzi ta rhumela mimpfi emahlweni ka n'wina, leyi yi nga ta hlongorisa Vahivhi, ni Vakanana, ni Vahiti, va suka emahlweni ka n'wina va famba.	And I will send hornets before you, which shall drive out the Hivites, the Canaanites, and the Hittites from before you.
A ndzi nga va hlongoli va suka hinkwavo emahlweni ka n'wina hi lembe rin'we ntsena, hikuva tiko ri nga ta tlhuma, kutani swiharhi swa nhova swi nga andza swi mi karhata.	I will not drive them out from before you in one year, lest the land become desolate and the wild beasts multiply against you.
Ndzi ta va hlongola hi vatsongo-vatsongo, va suka va huma exikarhi ka n'wina, ku kondza loko mi tswalelene mi andza ku ringana ku teka tiko ri va ra n'wina.	Little by little I will drive them out from before you, until you have increased and possess the land.
Ndzi ta ba mindzilekana ya tiko ra n'wina yi sukela eka Lwandle-ro-Tshwuka ku ya fika eLwandle ra Vafilista, ni ku suka emananga ya Sinayi ku ya fika enambyeni wa Yufrata, hikuva ndzi ta nyiketa vaaki va tiko emavokweni ya n'wina, mi va hlongola va suka emahlweni ka n'wina.	And I will set your border from the Red Sea to the Sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness to the Euphrates, for I will give the inhabitants of the land into your hand, and you shall drive them out before you.
Mi nga tshuki mi endla ntwanano na vona kumbe ku endla ntwanano ni swikwembu swa vona.	You shall make no covenant with them and their gods.
Vanhu lava a va fanelanga ku tshama etikweni ra n'wina, hikuva va nga mi kokela eku ndzi dyoheleni; naswona loko mi gandzela swikwembu swa vona, mi ta va mi tiphasa hi ntlhamu.	They shall not dwell in your land, lest they make you sin against me; for if you serve their gods, it will surely be a snare to you.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe: Tlhandluka u ta haleno ka mina, wena na Aroni, na Nadabu, na Abihu, ni vakulukumba va Israele vo ringana 70. Loko ma ha ri kule, nkhinsamani mi khongela.	Then he said to Moses, Come up to the LORD, you and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel, and worship from afar.
Wena Muxe, hi wena ntsena u nga ta tshinela kusuhi na mina HOSI; lava u nga na vona va nga tshuki va ta kusuhi; vanhu lavan'wana vona ni ku ringeta ku khandziya va nga ringeti!	Moses alone shall come near to the LORD, but the others shall not come near, and the people shall not come up with him.
Kutani Muxe a ya tivisa vanhu marito hinkwawo ya HOSI Xikwembu ni swileriso swa xona hinkwaswo; vanhu hinkwavo va hlamula hi nomo wun'we, va ku: Hinkwaswo leswi HOSI Xikwembu xi leriseke swona, hi ta swi endla.	Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD and all the rules. And all the people answered with one voice and said, All the words that the LORD has spoken we will do.
Kutani Muxe a tsala hinkwaswo leswi vuriweke hi HOSI Xikwembu. Siku leri tlhandlamaka a pfuka nimixo swinene, a aka alitari ehansi ka ntshava, a yimisa ni maribye lamakulu ya 12 ku ringanisa tinyimba ta Israele ta 12.	And Moses wrote down all the words of the LORD. He rose early in the morning and built an altar at the foot of the mountain, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel.
Kutani Muxe a rhuma majaha ya Israele ku tlhava tihomu, va humesela HOSI Xikwembu magandzelo lama hisiwaka ni ya xinakulobye.	And he sent young men of the people of Israel, who offered burnt offerings and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen to the LORD.
Muxe a chela ngati yin'wana eminkambaneni, leyin'wana a xuva alitari ha yona.	And Moses took half of the blood and put it in basins, and half of the blood he threw against the altar.
Kutani a teka buku ya Ntwanano, a yi hlayela Vaisraele, kutani va ku: Hinkwaswo leswi HOSI Xikwembu xi nga swi vula, hi ta swi endla; naswona hi ta yingisa.	Then he took the Book of the Covenant and read it in the hearing of the people. And they said, All that the LORD has spoken we will do, and we will be obedient.
Kutani Muxe a teka ngati, a xuva vanhu ha yona, a ku: Leyi i ngati ya ntwanano lowu HOSI Xikwembu xi nga wu endla na n'wina, hi ku landza marito lawa hinkwawo.	And Moses took the blood and threw it on the people and said, Behold the blood of the covenant that the LORD has made with you in accordance with all these words.
Muxe a khandziya ntshava a ri na Aroni, na Nadabu, na Abihu, ni vakulukumba va Israele va 70.	Then Moses and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel went up
Kutani va vona Xikwembu xa Israele; laha hansi ka milenge ya xona a wonge hiloko ku ri ni maribye ya nkoka swinene ya safiri, yo phatima ku fana ni rihlaza ra tilo.	and they saw the God of Israel. There was under his feet as it were a pavement of sapphire stone, like the very heaven for clearness.
HOSI Xikwembu a xi endlanga nchumu eka varhangeri lava va Israele, kambe va xi vonile, kutani va tshama ehansi va dya, ni ku tima torha.	And he did not lay his hand on the chief men of the people of Israel; they beheld God, and ate and drank.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe: Tlhandlukela haleno ka mina entshaveni, u fika u ndzi yimela; kutani ndzi ta ku nyika maribye ya swiphepherhele, lawa ndzi tsaleke nawu ni swileriso eka wona, eku letela Vaisraele ha swona.	The LORD said to Moses, Come up to me on the mountain and wait there, that I may give you the tablets of stone, with the law and the commandment, which I have written for their instruction.
Kutani Muxe na Yoxuwa museketeri wa yena va suka va famba; Muxe a sungula ku tlhandlukela entshaveni ya Xikwembu	So Moses rose with his assistant Joshua, and Moses went up into the mountain of God.
kutani a byela vakulukumba a ku: Hi yimeleni kwala hi kondza hi vuya. Aroni na Huri va ta sala na n'wina, kutani un'wana ni un'wana loyi a nga ta va ni mhaka leyi a lavaka ku pfuniwa eka yona, a a ye eka vona.	And he said to the elders, Wait here for us until we return to you. And behold, Aaron and Hur are with you. Whoever has a dispute, let him go to them.
Kutani Muxe a tlhandlukela entshaveni ya Sinayi, hiloko papa ri khubumeta ntshava.	Then Moses went up on the mountain, and the cloud covered the mountain.
Ku vonakala ka HOSI Xikwembu ku tshama ehenhla ka ntshava. Yi khubumetiwa hi papa masiku ya 6, kutani hi siku ra vu-7, HOSI Xikwembu xi vitana Muxe xi ri endzeni ka papa.	The glory of the LORD dwelt on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days. And on the seventh day he called to Moses out of the midst of the cloud.
Vaisraele a va vona ku vonakala ka HOSI Xikwembu, ehenhla ka ntshava, ku fana ni ndzilo lowu pfurhaka.	Now the appearance of the glory of the LORD was like a devouring fire on the top of the mountain in the sight of the people of Israel.
Kutani Muxe a nghena epapeni, a tlhandlukela entshaveni. Muxe ú tshamile entshaveni masiku ya 40 ni vusiku bya kona.	Moses entered the cloud and went up on the mountain. And Moses was on the mountain forty days and forty nights.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe	The LORD said to Moses
Vulavula ni Vaisraele leswaku va ndzi humesela nhlengo; mi ta wu hlengeleta wu huma eka vanhu hinkwavo lava tinyiketaka ku ndzi humesela wona hi mbilu yo basa.	Speak to the people of Israel, that they take for me a contribution. From every man whose heart moves him you shall receive the contribution for me.
Mihlengo leyi mi nga ta yi amukela eka vona hi leyi; Nsuku, ni silivhere, ni koporo	And this is the contribution that you shall receive from them: gold, silver, and bronze
ni voya bya tinyimpfu bya muhlovo wa rihlaza ra tilo, ni wa xivunguvungu, ni lowo tshwuka, ni ntsembyani lowo saseka, ni voya bya timbuti	blue and purple and scarlet yarns and fine twined linen, goats' hair
ni madzovo ya tinyimpfu lama tlhuvutsiweke, ni madzovo ya timbuti, ni mapulangi ya murhi wa munga	tanned rams' skins, goatskins, acacia wood
ni mafurha yo voninga, ni mirhi yo nun'hwerisa mafurha yo tola, ni swinun'hweriso swa mirhi leyi hisiwaka egandzelweni	oil for the lamps, spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense
ni maribye ya nkoka ya ‘onikisi’, ni lama nga ta vekeriwa engubyeni ya vaprista ya ‘efodi’ ni le xincekaneni xa vona xa le xifuveni.	onyx stones, and stones for setting, for the ephod and for the breastpiece.
Kutani va ta ndzi endlela xivandla lexo hlawuleka leswaku ndzi ta tshama exikarhi ka vona.	And let them make me a sanctuary, that I may dwell in their midst.
Mi ta endla Ntsonga ni swingolongondzwana swa wona hinkwaswo hi swivumbeko leswi ndzi nga ta mi komba swona.	Exactly as I show you concerning the pattern of the tabernacle, and of all its furniture, so you shall make it.

These are the garments that they shall make: a breastpiece, an ephod, a robe, a coat of checker work, a turban, and a sash. They shall make holy garments for Aaron your brother and his sons to serve me as priests.

Va ta rhunga efodi hi voya bya muhlovo wa nsuku, ni wa rihlaza ra tilo, ni wa xivunguvungu, ni lowo tshwuka, ni ntsembyani wo saseka lowu lukiweke, lowu rhungeleriweke swifaniso.	And they shall make the ephod of gold, of blue and purple and scarlet yarns, and of fine twined linen, skillfully worked.

Vamba leri nga ta tiyisa ni ku boha efodi, ri ta rhungiwa ku fana na yona, hi voya byo fana bya muhlovo wa nsuku, ni wa rihlaza ra tilo, ni wa xivunguvungu, ni lowo tshwuka, ni ntsembyani wo saseka lowu lukiweke.	And the skillfully woven band on it shall be made like it and be of one piece with it, of gold, blue and purple and scarlet yarns, and fine twined linen.

Mi ta kevetla mavito ya vana va Yakobo emaribyeni lawa mambirhi, tanihi munhu loyi a kevetlelaka maribye ya nkoka a endla mimfungho; kutani mi ta vekela maribye lawa eka swiangarhelo swa nsuku	As a jeweler engraves signets, so shall you engrave the two stones with the names of the sons of Israel. You shall enclose them in settings of gold filigree.
kutani mi ta bohelela maribye ya kona etingotini ta efodi ta le makatleni, leswaku ma ta va xikombiso xa tinyimba ta Israele; naswona Aroni ú ta rhwala mavito lawa emakatleni ya yena loko a ta emahlweni ka mina HOSI Xikwembu, ma ta ndzi tsundzuxa tinyimba leti.	And you shall set the two stones on the shoulder pieces of the ephod, as stones of remembrance for the sons of Israel. And Aaron shall bear their names before the LORD on his two shoulders for remembrance.
Kutani mi ta endla swikhomiso swimbirhi swa nsuku	You shall make settings of gold filigree
mi endla ni swinketanana swimbirhi hi nsuku lowu tengeke, swi lukiwa ku fana ni tingoti, kutani mi swi bohelela eka swikhomiso.	and two chains of pure gold, twisted like cords; and you shall attach the corded chains to the settings.
Kutani mi ta endla xincekana xa le xifuveni, xo ambariwa loko ku avanyisiwa timhaka, mi xi rhungelela swifaniso.

Ku ta va ni maribye ya 12 lama nga ta va ni mavito ya vana va Yakobo eka wona. Ribye rin'wana ni rin'wana ri ta yimela yin'wana ya tinyimba ta 12 ta Israele, ri kevetliwile ku fana ni mfungho.	There shall be twelve stones with their names according to the names of the sons of Israel. They shall be like signets, each engraved with its name, for the twelve tribes.
Kutani mi ta endlela xincekana xa le xifuveni etinketani letitsongo leti swuriweke ku fana ni tingoti, hi nsuku lowo tenga	You shall make for the breastpiece twisted chains like cords, of pure gold.
mi ta xi endlela ni swingwavila swimbirhi hi nsuku, mi swi vekela etinhleni ta xona leti timbirhi.	And you shall make for the breastpiece two rings of gold, and put the two rings on the two edges of the breastpiece.
Kutani mi ta nghenisa swinketanana leswimbirhi swa nsuku eswingwavileni leswi swimbirhi, leswi nga etinhleni ta xincekana.	And you shall put the two cords of gold in the two rings at the edges of the breastpiece.
Mi ta boha makumu laman'wana ya swinketanana leswimbirhi eka swikhomiso leswimbirhi swa nsuku; kutani hi ndlela leyi, mi ta swi khomisa eka tingoti ta efodi ta le makatleni, hi laha mahlweni ka yona.	The two ends of the two cords you shall attach to the two settings of filigree, and so attach it in front to the shoulder pieces of the ephod.
Kutani mi ta endla swingwavila swimbirhi hi nsuku, mi swi vekela eka makumu mambirhi ya xincekana xa le xifuveni, enson'weni wa xona wa le ndzeni, kusuhi ni efodi.	You shall make two rings of gold, and put them at the two ends of the breastpiece, on its inside edge next to the ephod.
Mi ta endla swingwavila swin'wana swimbirhi hi nsuku; swona mi ta swi vekela emahlweni, hi le hansi ka tingoti ta efodi ta le makatleni, laha tingoti leti ti hlanganaka kona, ehenhla ka vamba ra efodi.	And you shall make two rings of gold, and attach them in front to the lower part of the two shoulder pieces of the ephod, at its seam above the skillfully woven band of the ephod.
Swingwavila leswi swi ta khomisa xincekana xa le xifuveni eswingwavileni swa efodi, swi boheleriwa hi ngoti ya rihlaza ra tilo, ku endlela leswaku xincekana xi tshama ehenhla ka vamba ra efodi, xi nga tshuki xi suka eka yona.	And they shall bind the breastpiece by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, so that it may lie on the skillfully woven band of the ephod, so that the breastpiece shall not come loose from the ephod.
Kutani loko Aroni a ta exivandleni lexo hlawuleka, ú ta rhwala mavito ya tinyimba ta Israele ma ri exincekaneni xa le xifuveni lexi ambariwaka loko ku avanyisiwa timhaka; mavito lawa ma ta va henhla ka mbilu ya yena, ku endlela leswaku mina HOSI Xikwembu ndzi tshama ndzi ri karhi ndzi ma tsundzuka.	So Aaron shall bear the names of the sons of Israel in the breastpiece of judgment on his heart, when he goes into the Holy Place, to bring them to regular remembrance before the LORD.
Endzeni ka xincekana lexi xa le xifuveni, mi ta nghenisa ‘Urimi’ na ‘Thumimi’, swi nga swilo leswi swi nga ta va exifuveni xa Aroni etlhelweni ra ximatsi, loko a ta emahlweni ka mina HOSI; hi ndlela leyi, Aroni ú ta tshama a rhwale ehenhla ka mbilu ya yena leswi swi nga ta n'wi pfuna ku avanyisa timhaka ta Vaisraele emahlweni ka mina HOSI Xikwembu.	And in the breastpiece of judgment you shall put the Urim and the Thummim, and they shall be on Aaron's heart, when he goes in before the LORD. Thus Aaron shall bear the judgment of the people of Israel on his heart before the LORD regularly.
Nguvu leyo leha leyi nga ta ambariwa na efodi, mi ta yi luka hi voya bya muhlovo wa rihlaza ra tilo ntsena.	You shall make the robe of the ephod all of blue.
Nguvu leyi yi ta va ni mbhovo, laha nhloko yi nga ta nghena hi kona, ku fana ni le tingubyeni ta madzovo.

It shall have an opening for the head in the middle of it, with a woven binding around the opening, like the opening in a garment, so that it may not tear.
Emakumu ka nguvu leyi ehansi, mi ta rhungelela swifaniso swa swihenge, hi voya bya muhlovo wa rihlaza ra tilo, ni wa xivunguvungu, ni lowo tshwuka; mi ta swi rhungelela swi rhendzeleka ni nguvu, kutani exikarhi ka swona mi ta vekela swingelengele swa nsuku.	On its hem you shall make pomegranates of blue and purple and scarlet yarns, around its hem, with bells of gold between them

Kutani Aroni ú ta ambala nguvu leyi yo leha, loko a ri karhi a tirha ntirho wa vuprista; mpfumawulo wa swingelengele swa yona wu ta twala loko a nghena exivandleni lexo hlawuleka ni loko a huma, hikuva loko swi nga ri tano, a nga fa.	And it shall be on Aaron when he ministers, and its sound shall be heard when he goes into the Holy Place before the LORD, and when he comes out, so that he does not die.
Mi ta fula nsuku lowo tenga wu va xiphepherhele, eka xona mi kevetla marito lama nge: ‘La hlawuleriweke HOSI’, ku fana ni loko ku kevetliwa mfungho.	You shall make a plate of pure gold and engrave on it, like the engraving of a signet, 'Holy to the LORD.'
Mi ta bohelela nsuku lowu wa xiphepherhele eka xihuku hi ngoti ya rihlaza ra tilo; xi ta va emahlweni ka xihuku.	And you shall fasten it on the turban by a cord of blue. It shall be on the front of the turban.
Aroni ú fanele ku vekela xiphepherhele lexi emombyeni wa yena; ú ta byarha xidyoho xa mhamba yin'wana ni yin'wana leyo hlawuleka leyi Vaisraele va nga ta va va nga yi humesanga hi ndlela leyinene. Aroni ú ta tshama a vekerile xiphepherhele lexi emombyeni wa yena, leswaku magandzelo ma ta amukeleka emahlweni ka mina HOSI.	It shall be on Aaron's forehead, and Aaron shall bear any guilt from the holy things that the people of Israel consecrate as their holy gifts. It shall regularly be on his forehead, that they may be accepted before the LORD.
Mi ta luka hembe ya mavalavala ni xihuku hi ntsembyani lowo saseka; vamba rona mi ta ri rhungelela mavalavala.	You shall weave the coat in checker work of fine linen, and you shall make a turban of fine linen, and you shall make a sash embroidered with needlework.
Mi ta rhunga tihembe ni mavamba ni swihuku leswitsongo, mi rhungela vana va Aroni leswaku swi ta va nyika ndzhuti ni ku languteka.	For Aaron's sons you shall make coats and sashes and caps. You shall make them for glory and beauty.
U ta ambexa makwenu Aroni ni vana va yena eswiambalo leswi swa vuprista, u va chela mafurha enhlokweni, u va veka ni ku va hlawulekisa leswaku va ta va vaprista, va ndzi tirhela.	And you shall put them on Aaron your brother, and on his sons with him, and shall anoint them and ordain them and consecrate them, that they may serve me as priests.
Mi ta va rhungela swiburukwana swo siva miri ha swona, swi suka exisutini swi ya fika ehenhla ka matsolo.	You shall make for them linen undergarments to cover their naked flesh. They shall reach from the hips to the thighs
Swiburukwana leswi swi fanele ku ambariwa hi Aroni ni vana va yena, loko va nghena eka Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka, kumbe loko va ta kusuhi ni alitari ku ya tirha exivandleni lexo hlawuleka; loko va nga endlisi sweswo, va ta tivangela khombo, va fa. Lowu wu ta va nawu lowu bohaka Aroni ni vatukulu va yena hilaha ku nga heriki.	and they shall be on Aaron and on his sons when they go into the tent of meeting or when they come near the altar to minister in the Holy Place, lest they bear guilt and die. This shall be a statute forever for him and for his offspring after him.
Leswi u nga ta swi endla eka Aroni ni vana va yena loko u va hlawulekisa leswaku va va vaprista va ndzi tirhela, hi leswi: U ta lava xinkuzana ni makhuna mambirhi ya tinyimpfu lama nga solekiki.	Now this is what you shall do to them to consecrate them, that they may serve me as priests. Take one bull of the herd and two rams without blemish
U ta lava ni xinkwa, ni swimbhundzwa leswi swekiweke hi mafurha, ni xinkwa xo oma lexi totiweke mafurha, hinkwaswo swi ri leswi swekiweke hi mapa lamanene ya koroni, swi nga cheriwanga comela.	and unleavened bread, unleavened cakes mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers smeared with oil.

Kutani u ta swi nghenisa exirhundzwini; u swi tisa swi ri endzeni ka xona, siku u tisaka xinkuzana ni makhuna mambirhi.	You shall put them in one basket and bring them in the basket, and bring the bull and the two rams.
U ta ta na Aroni ni vana va yena va xinuna enyangweni ya Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka, kutani u ta va hlambisa hi mati.	You shall bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the tent of meeting and wash them with water.
Kutani u ta teka swiambalo swa vuprista, u ambexa Aroni hembe ni nguvu leyo leha leyi ambariwaka ni efodi, u n'wi ambexa ni efodi, ni xincekana xa le xifuveni, u n'wi khama hi vamba ra efodi	Then you shall take the garments, and put on Aaron the coat and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastpiece, and gird him with the skillfully woven band of the ephod.
u n'wi ambexa xihuku enhlokweni, u vekela ni harhi leyo hlawuleka ya xiphepherhele exihukwini.	And you shall set the turban on his head and put the holy crown on the turban.
Kutani u teka mafurha layo hlawuleka, u n'wi chela enhlokweni, u n'wi tota.	You shall take the anointing oil and pour it on his head and anoint him.
U ta ta ni vana va Aroni va xinuna, u va ambexa tihembe	Then you shall bring his sons and put coats on them
u va khama hi mavamba, u va boha swihuku leswitsongo etinhlokweni. Hi swona leswi u nga ta vekisa swona Aroni ni vana va yena, kutani ntirho wa vuprista wu ta va wa vona hi nawu hilaha ku nga heriki.	and you shall gird Aaron and his sons with sashes and bind caps on them. And the priesthood shall be theirs by a statute forever. Thus you shall ordain Aaron and his sons.
Kutani u ta tisa xinkuzana emahlweni ka Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka. Aroni ni vana va yena va ta tlhandleka mavoko enhlokweni ya xinkuzana lexi	Then you shall bring the bull before the tent of meeting. Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on the head of the bull.
u ta xi tlhava emahlweni ka mina HOSI, kwala nyangweni ya Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka.	Then you shall kill the bull before the LORD at the entrance of the tent of meeting
Kutani u ta teka ngatinyana ya xinkuzana, u tota etimhondzweni ta alitari hi ritiho, ngati leyin'wana hinkwayo u ta yi chela ehansi ka alitari.	and shall take part of the blood of the bull and put it on the horns of the altar with your finger, and the rest of the blood you shall pour out at the base of the altar.
Kutani u ta teka mpambani hinkwawo, ni tlhelo lero saseka ra xivindzi, ni tinso hi timbirhi ka tona, ni mafurha ya kona, u swi hisa ehenhla ka alitari.	And you shall take all the fat that covers the entrails, and the long lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them, and burn them on the altar.
Kambe nyama ya xinkuzana, ni dzovo ra xona, ni nswanyi, u ta ya swi hisa hi ndzilo ehandle ka mixaxa. Leyi hi yona mhamba ya ku susa swidyoho.	But the flesh of the bull and its skin and its dung you shall burn with fire outside the camp; it is a sin offering.
U ta teka rin'wana ra makhuna; Aroni ni vana va yena va ta tlhandleka mavoko enhlokweni ya rona	Then you shall take one of the rams, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on the head of the ram
kutani u ta ri tlhava, u teka ngati ya rona, u xuva alitari matlhelo hinkwawo.	and you shall kill the ram and shall take its blood and throw it against the sides of the altar.
U ta tsemelela nyama ya khuna, u hlantswa swa le ndzeni ni manqina ya rona, u swi veka endhawini yin'we ni nyama ni nhloko ya rona.	Then you shall cut the ram into pieces, and wash its entrails and its legs, and put them with its pieces and its head
Kutani u hisa khuna hinkwaro ehenhla ka alitari. Lawa hi wona magandzelo lama hisiwaka, lama humeseriwaka mina HOSI Xikwembu; hi yona mhamba leyi hiseriwaka mina, leyi ku nun'hwela ka yona ku nga ta ndzi tsakisa.	and burn the whole ram on the altar. It is a burnt offering to the LORD. It is a pleasing aroma, a food offering to the LORD.
U ta teka khuna lerin'wana; Aroni ni vana va yena va ta tlhandleka mavoko ya vona enhlokweni ya rona.	You shall take the other ram, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on the head of the ram
Kutani u ta ri tlhava, u teka ngatinyana, u tota Aroni ni vana va yena emakumu ka ndleve ya xinene, ni le khudzwini ra voko ra xinene, ni le khudzwini ra nenge wa xinene; ngati leyin'wana hinkwayo, u ta xuva ha yona alitari matlhelo hinkwawo.	and you shall kill the ram and take part of its blood and put it on the tip of the right ear of Aaron and on the tips of the right ears of his sons, and on the thumbs of their right hands and on the great toes of their right feet, and throw the rest of the blood against the sides of the altar.
U ta teka ngati yin'wana eka leyi nga alitarini, u teka ni mafurha layo tola, u xuva Aroni ni vana va yena ni swiambalo swa vona swa vuprista; kutani Aroni ni vana va yena va ta va va hlawulekile, ni swiambalo swa vona swa vuprista swi ta va swi hlawulekile.	Then you shall take part of the blood that is on the altar, and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it on Aaron and his garments, and on his sons and his sons' garments with him. He and his garments shall be holy, and his sons and his sons' garments with him.
U ta teka mafurha ya khuna leri, ni ncila, ni mpambani, ni tlhelo lero saseka ra xivindzi, ni tinso ha timbirhi ka tona ni mafurha ya kona, ni nenge wa xinene, hikuva i khuna leri tlhaveriwaka ku vekiwa ka vaprista	You shall also take the fat from the ram and the fat tail and the fat that covers the entrails, and the long lobe of the liver and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them, and the right thigh (for it is a ram of ordination)
u ta pambula ni xinkwa xin'we, ni ximbhundzwa xin'we lexi swekiweke hi mafurha, ni xinkwa xin'we xo oma exirhundzwini xa leswo-ke-comela leswi nga emahlweni ka HOSI Xikwembu.	and one loaf of bread and one cake of bread made with oil, and one wafer out of the basket of unleavened bread that is before the LORD.
Swilo leswi hinkwaswo, u ta swi khomisa Aroni ni vana va yena, u va byela ku ndzi widzela swona, yi va nyiko leyo hlawuleka ya mina HOSI Xikwembu.	You shall put all these on the palms of Aaron and on the palms of his sons, and wave them for a wave offering before the LORD.
Kutani u ta swi teka emavokweni ya vona, u swi katsa ni magandzelo lama hisiwaka, u swi hisa ehenhla ka alitari, yi va mhamba leyi hiseriwaka mina HOSI Xikwembu, leyi ku nun'hwela ka yona ku nga ta ndzi tsakisa.	Then you shall take them from their hands and burn them on the altar on top of the burnt offering, as a pleasing aroma before the LORD. It is a food offering to the LORD.
U ta teka xifuva xa khuna leri tlhaveriwaka ku vekiwa ka Aroni, u ndzi widzela xona, yi va nyiko leyo hlawuleka ya mina HOSI Xikwembu; hi yona nyama leyi u nga ta kuma yona eka xifuwo lexi.	You shall take the breast of the ram of Aaron's ordination and wave it for a wave offering before the LORD, and it shall be your portion.
Eka khuna leri tlhaveriwaka ku vekiwa ka vaprista, u ta hlawulekisa xifuva, xi va nyiko leyo hlawuleka, ni nenge wa kona lowu nyikiwaka vaprista; swi ta va swa Aroni ni vana va yena.	And you shall consecrate the breast of the wave offering that is waved and the thigh of the priests' portion that is contributed from the ram of ordination, from what was Aaron's and his sons'.
Aroni ni vana va yena va ta nyikiwa nyama leyi hi nawu lowu nga ta boha Vaisraele hilaha ku nga heriki, hikuva hi yona nyiko eka vaprista, leyi Vaisraele va nga ta yi pambula eka magandzelo ya vona ya xinakulobye; i mhamba ya vona leyi va yi humeselaka mina HOSI Xikwembu.	It shall be for Aaron and his sons as a perpetual due from the people of Israel, for it is a contribution. It shall be a contribution from the people of Israel from their peace offerings, their contribution to the LORD.
Swiambalo swa Aroni leswo hlawuleka swi ta sala swi va swa vana va yena loko a hundzile emisaveni; va ta ambala swona siku va vekiwaka ku va vaprista hi ku cheriwa mafurha enhlokweni.	The holy garments of Aaron shall be for his sons after him; they shall be anointed in them and ordained in them.
N'wana loyi a nga ta siva Aroni entirhweni wa vuprista, ú ta ambala swiambalo leswi masiku ya 7, loko a nghena eka Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka ku ya tirha exivandleni xa wona lexo hlawuleka.	The son who succeeds him as priest, who comes into the tent of meeting to minister in the Holy Place, shall wear them seven days.
U ta teka nyama ya khuna leri tlhaveriwaka ku vekiwa ka vaprista, u yi swekela endhawini leyi hlawulekeke.	You shall take the ram of ordination and boil its flesh in a holy place.
Aroni ni vana va yena va ta dya nyama ya khuna leri ni xinkwa lexi nga xirhundzwini, va swi dyela enyangweni ya Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka.	And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram and the bread that is in the basket in the entrance of the tent of meeting.
Va ta dya swilo leswi tirhisiweke ku humesa mhamba ya ku susa swidyoho, siku va vekiweke ni ku hlawulekisiwa. Kambe munhu wa le handle a nga tshuki a dya swilo leswi, hikuva swi hlawulekile.	They shall eat those things with which atonement was made at their ordination and consecration, but an outsider shall not eat of them, because they are holy.
Loko, siku leri tlhandlamaka nimpundzu, ka ha sale nyama ya siku ra ku vekiwa ka vaprista, kumbe xinkwa xa kona, u ta swi hisa; swi nga tshuki swi dyiwa, hikuva swi hlawulekile.	And if any of the flesh for the ordination or of the bread remain until the morning, then you shall burn the remainder with fire. It shall not be eaten, because it is holy.
U ta endlela Aroni ni vana va yena hinkwaswo leswi ndzi nga ku lerisa swona; ntirho wa ku va veka wu ta teka masiku ya 7.	Thus you shall do to Aaron and to his sons, according to all that I have commanded you. Through seven days shall you ordain them
Siku rin'wana ni rin'wana, u ta humesa magandzelo hi ku tlhava xinkuzana, xi va mhamba ya ku susa swidyoho. Na yona alitari u ta yi humesela emagandzelo, yi va mhamba ya ku yi basisa; u ta yi hlawulekisa hi ku yi tota mafurha.	and every day you shall offer a bull as a sin offering for atonement. Also you shall purify the altar, when you make atonement for it, and shall anoint it to consecrate it.
Hi masiku lawa ya 7, u ta humesela alitari emhamba ya ku yi basisa, u yi hlawulekisa; hikokwalaho yi ta va leyi hlawulekeke swinene, kutani xin'wana ni xin'wana lexi nga ta khumbana na alitari xi ta hundzuka lexi hlawulekeke.	Seven days you shall make atonement for the altar and consecrate it, and the altar shall be most holy. Whatever touches the altar shall become holy.
Siku rin'wana ni rin'wana hilaha ku nga heriki, mi ta humesa swinyimpfana swimbirhi swa makhuna swa lembe rin'we alitarini.	Now this is what you shall offer on the altar: two lambs a year old day by day regularly.
Mi ta humesa xinyimpfana xin'we nimixo, xin'wana namadyambu.	One lamb you shall offer in the morning, and the other lamb you shall offer at twilight.
Lexo sungula, mi ta xi humesa ni xintewana xin'we xa mapa lamanene ya koroni lama pfanganyisiweke ni xikhudza xin'we xa mafurha layo tenga ya mutlhwari, mi chela ni jomela rin'we ra vhinyo ya magandzelo.	And with the first lamb a tenth measure of fine flour mingled with a fourth of a hin of beaten oil, and a fourth of a hin of wine for a drink offering.
Xinyimpfana lexa vumbirhi xa namadyambu, mi ta xi humesa ni magandzelo ya mapa lama katsiweke ni vhinyo, ku fana ni swa nimixo; ma ta va magandzelo lama hiseriwaka mina HOSI Xikwembu, lawa ku nun'hwela ka wona ku nga ta ndzi tsakisa.	The other lamb you shall offer at twilight, and shall offer with it a grain offering and its drink offering, as in the morning, for a pleasing aroma, a food offering to the LORD.
Vatukulu va n'wina hinkwavo na vona va ta ya emahlweni va humesa magandzelo lama hisiwaka lawa, ma humeseriwa enyangweni ya Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka, emahlweni ka mina HOSI. Kona kwalaho ndzi ta hlangana na n'wina, ndzi vulavula na n'wina.	It shall be a regular burnt offering throughout your generations at the entrance of the tent of meeting before the LORD, where I will meet with you, to speak to you there.
Ndzi ta hlangana ni Vaisraele endhawini yoleyo, kutani ku kwetsima ka mina ku ta yi hlawulekisa.	There I will meet with the people of Israel, and it shall be sanctified by my glory.
Ndzi ta hlawulekisa Ntsonga ni alitari ya kona; na yena Aroni ni vana va yena, ndzi ta va hlawulekisa leswaku va va vaprista, va ndzi tirhela.	I will consecrate the tent of meeting and the altar. Aaron also and his sons I will consecrate to serve me as priests.
Ndzi ta tshama exikarhi ka Vaisraele, kutani eka vona, ndzi ta va Xikwembu.	I will dwell among the people of Israel and will be their God.
Va ta tiva leswaku mina HOSI, ndzi Xikwembu xa vona lexi xi va humeseke etikweni ra Egipta, leswaku ndzi ta tshama exikarhi ka vona. Hi mina HOSI, Xikwembu xa vona.	And they shall know that I am the LORD their God, who brought them out of the land of Egypt that I might dwell among them. I am the LORD their God.
Mi ta endla alitari yo hisela kona mirhi ya risuna mi yi endla hi mapulangi ya murhi wa munga.	You shall make an altar on which to burn incense; you shall make it of acacia wood.
Ehenhla ni le hansi ka yona, ku ta ringanana: 50 cm ku leha ni 50 cm ku anama, ni 100 cm ku ya ehenhla; timhondzo ta yona ti ta khomana na yona.	A cubit shall be its length, and a cubit its breadth. It shall be square, and two cubits shall be its height. Its horns shall be of one piece with it.
Mi ta yi nameka nsuku lowo tenga, ehenhla ni le matlhelo hinkwawo, mi nameka ni timhondzo ta yona, mi endla ni nkonye wa nsuku ku rhendzeleka na yona.	You shall overlay it with pure gold, its top and around its sides and its horns. And you shall make a molding of gold around it.
Mi ta yi endlela ni swingwavila swimbirhi hi nsuku, mi swi vekela ehansi ka nkonye hi matlhelo mambirhi ya yona; eka swona ku ta tlhomiwa timhandze to rhwala alitari ha tona.	And you shall make two golden rings for it. Under its molding on two opposite sides of it you shall make them, and they shall be holders for poles with which to carry it.
Timhandze ta kona mi ta ti vatla hi murhi wa munga, mi ti nameka nsuku.	You shall make the poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold.
Mi ta veka alitari emahlweni ka xisirhelelo lexi sivaka Areka ya Ntwanano, laha ndzi nga ta hlangana na n'wina kona.	And you shall put it in front of the veil that is above the ark of the testimony, in front of the mercy seat that is above the testimony, where I will meet with you.
Kutani Aroni ú ta hisa swinun'hweriso ehenhla ka yona mpundzu wun'wana ni wun'wana; ú ta swi hisa enkarhini lowu a lunghisaka timboni ha wona.	And Aaron shall burn fragrant incense on it. Every morning when he dresses the lamps he shall burn it
Ú ta tlhela a hisa swinun'hweriso leswi namadyambu, enkarhini lowu a lumekaka timboni ha wona; vatukulu va n'wina hinkwavo na vona va ta humesa magandzelo lawa ya mirhi ya risuna emahlweni ka mina HOSI, hilaha ku nga heriki.	and when Aaron sets up the lamps at twilight, he shall burn it, a regular incense offering before the LORD throughout your generations.
Ehenhla ka alitari leyi, mi nga tshuki mi hisa mirhi ya risuna leyi mi nga lerisiwangiki yona, mi nga humeseli kona magandzelo ya nyama ni ya mapa, naswona mi nga cheli swakunwa swa magandzelo ehenhla ka yona.	You shall not offer unauthorized incense on it, or a burnt offering, or a grain offering, and you shall not pour a drink offering on it.
Kan'we hi lembe, Aroni ú ta basisa alitari hi ku teka ngatinyana ya xifuwo lexi tlhaveriweke mhamba yo susa swidyoho, a tota timhondzo ta alitari; alitari yi ta basisiwa hi ndlela leyi kan'we hi lembe, ni le ka vatukulu va n'wina hinkwavo. Alitari leyi yi ta va yi hlawulekile ngopfu eka mina HOSI.	Aaron shall make atonement on its horns once a year. With the blood of the sin offering of atonement he shall make atonement for it once in the year throughout your generations. It is most holy to the LORD.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe	The LORD said to Moses
Loko ku hlayiwa ntsengo wa Vaisraele lava taka eku tsariseni, un'wana ni un'wana wa vona ú ta humesa nhlengo wa ku kutsula vutomi bya yena, a humesela mina HOSI Xikwembu, siku vanhu va hlayiwaka, leswaku va nga tshuki va wela hi ntungu, loko va ri karhi va hlayiwa.	When you take the census of the people of Israel, then each shall give a ransom for his life to the LORD when you number them, that there be no plague among them when you number them.
Un'wana ni un'wana la hundzaka eku hlayiweni, ú ta humesa nhlengo wa silivhere ya 6 g, yi nga hafu ya ntiko wo pima ha wona, lowu hlayisiwaka exivandleni lexo hlawuleka; nhlengo lowu wu ta va wa mina HOSI	Each one who is numbered in the census shall give this: half a shekel according to the shekel of the sanctuary (the shekel is twenty gerahs), half a shekel as an offering to the LORD.
wu humesiwa hi munhu un'wana ni un'wana wa malembe ya 20 ni ku ya ehenhla la taka eku hlayiweni.	Everyone who is numbered in the census, from twenty years old and upward, shall give the LORD's offering.
Mufumi a nga ka a nga humesi ku tlula silivhere ya 6 g, ni xisiwana a xi nga humesi ehansi ka silivhere yo ringana na yoleyo, loko mi ri karhi mi humesa nhlengo wa mina wo kutsula vutomi bya n'wina ha wona.	The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less, than the half shekel, when you give the LORD's offering to make atonement for your lives.
Mi ta amukela nhlengo wa kona eka Vaisraele, kutani mi wu tirhisa ku fambisa mintirho ya Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka; nhlengo lowu wa ku kutsula vutomi bya n'wina, wu ta endla leswaku mina HOSI ndzi tsundzuka Vaisraele.	You shall take the atonement money from the people of Israel and shall give it for the service of the tent of meeting, that it may bring the people of Israel to remembrance before the LORD, so as to make atonement for your lives.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe	The LORD said to Moses

You shall also make a basin of bronze, with its stand of bronze, for washing. You shall put it between the tent of meeting and the altar, and you shall put water in it
Mati lawa, Aroni ni vana va yena va ta hlamba mavoko ni milenge ha wona.	with which Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet.
Loko va nghena eka Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka, kumbe loko va tshinela kusuhi ni alitari ku ya tirha kona, ni ku ndzi hisela magandzelo mina HOSI Xikwembu, va ta rhanga hi ku hlamba hi mati lawa, leswaku va nga tshuki va fa.	When they go into the tent of meeting, or when they come near the altar to minister, to burn a food offering to the LORD, they shall wash with water, so that they may not die.
Va ta hlamba mavoko ni milenge, hikuva loko va nga endlisi sweswo, va ta fa. Lowu i nawu lowu nga ta ka wu nga hundzuki, eka Aroni ni vana va yena, wu ta boha hambi va ri vatukulu va yena, hilaha ku nga heriki.	They shall wash their hands and their feet, so that they may not die. It shall be a statute forever to them, even to him and to his offspring throughout their generations.

Aroni ni vana va yena, na vona mi ta va chela mafurha lawa, mi va hlawulekisa leswaku va va vaprista, va ndzi tirhela.	You shall anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them, that they may serve me as priests.

And you shall say to the people of Israel, 'This shall be my holy anointing oil throughout your generations.
Munhu ntsena, a nga tshuki a totiwa mafurha lawa, naswona mi nga tshuki mi endla mafurha man'wana, hi ku chela mimpimo leyi fanaka ni leyi tirhisiweke ku endla mafurha lawa; wona ma hlawulekile, kutani mi fanele ku ma tirhisa hi ndlela yo hlawuleka.	It shall not be poured on the body of an ordinary person, and you shall make no other like it in composition. It is holy, and it shall be holy to you.

Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe	And the LORD said to Moses
Byela Vaisraele leswaku ndzi ri: ‘Tsundzukani ngopfu-ngopfu ku hlayisa masiku lawa ndzi ma vekeke ya Savata, hikuva siku ra ku wisa i xikombiso xa ku twanana ka mina na n'wina, ni le ka vatukulu va n'wina hinkwavo swi va tano, mi ta tiva leswaku loyi a mi hlawulekisaka, hi mina HOSI.	You are to speak to the people of Israel and say, 'Above all you shall keep my Sabbaths, for this is a sign between me and you throughout your generations, that you may know that I, the LORD, sanctify you.
Mi ta hlayisa siku ra ku wisa, hikuva i siku leri eka n'wina ri nga ta va ri hlawulekile. Un'wana ni un'wana loyi a tlulaka nawu wa siku leri, ú ta dlayiwa. Loyi a tshukaka a tirha ntirho wun'wana hi siku leri, ú ta susiwa erixakeni ra ka vona.	You shall keep the Sabbath, because it is holy for you. Everyone who profanes it shall be put to death. Whoever does any work on it, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.
Ku ta tirhiwa hi masiku ya 6, kambe siku ra vu-7 i siku ra ku wisa ra Savata, leri hlawuleriweke HOSI Xikwembu; un'wana ni un'wana loyi a nga ta tirha hi siku leri ra Savata, ú ta dlayiwa.	Six days shall work be done, but the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest, holy to the LORD. Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day shall be put to death.
Hikokwalaho Vaisraele va fanele ku hlayisa siku ra ku wisa ra Savata, va ri xixima, wu va ntwanano lowu bohaka ni le ka vatukulu va vona hilaha ku nga heriki.	Therefore the people of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, observing the Sabbath throughout their generations, as a covenant forever.
Lexi xi ta va xikombiso xa ku twanana ka mina ni Vaisraele hilaha ku nga heriki; hikuva hi masiku ya 6 mina HOSI ndzi tumbuluxile tilo ni misava, kutani ndzi tshika ku tirha hi siku ra vu-7, ndzi wisa.’ 	It is a sign forever between me and the people of Israel that in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested and was refreshed.'
Loko Xikwembu xi heta ku vulavula na Muxe entshaveni ya Sinayi, xi n'wi nyika maribye lawa mambirhi ya Ntwanano, ma nga maribye ya swiphepherhele lawa Xikwembu xi tsaleke milawu eka wona hi ritiho ra xona.	And he gave to Moses, when he had finished speaking with him on Mount Sinai, the two tablets of the testimony, tablets of stone, written with the finger of God.
Loko Vaisraele va vona leswaku Muxe wa hlwela ku rhelela a vuya hi le ntshaveni, va vitanana va ya hlengeletana eka Aroni, va ku ka yena: Hatlisa u hi endlela xikwembu lexi nga ta hi rhangela emahlweni, hikuva a hi tivi leswaku Muxe wa kona loyi a nga hi susa etikweni ra Egipta, ú helele kwihi.	When the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mountain, the people gathered themselves together to Aaron and said to him, Up, make us gods who shall go before us. As for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.
Kutani Aroni a ku ka vona: Anyulani swingwavila swa nsuku leswi nga tindleveni ta vasati va n'wina, ni ta vana va n'wina va xinuna ni va xisati, mi ndzi tisela swona.	So Aaron said to them, Take off the rings of gold that are in the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters, and bring them to me.
Kavaloko vanhu hinkwavo va anyuletela swingwavila swa nsuku leswi a swi ri tindleveni ta vona, va swi yisa eka Aroni.	So all the people took off the rings of gold that were in their ears and brought them to Aaron.
Kutani Aroni a amukela nsuku eka vona, a wu n'okisa exibyeni xo n'okisela eka xona, a vumba xifaniso xa rhole; hiloko vanhu va ku: N'wina Vaisraele, hi lexi Xikwembu xa n'wina, lexi xi mi humeseke etikweni ra Egipta!	And he received the gold from their hand and fashioned it with a graving tool and made a golden calf. And they said, These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!
Loko Aroni a vona leswi humelelaka, a aka alitari emahlweni ka rhole, kutani a tivisa vanhu, a ku: Mundzuku ku ta va ni nkhuvo wa ku tlangela HOSI Xikwembu.	When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it. And Aaron made a proclamation and said, Tomorrow shall be a feast to the LORD.
Hi siku leri tlhandlamaka, va pfuka wa ha ri mpundzu, va humesa magandzelo lama hisiwaka ni ya xinakulobye; kutani vanhu va tshama ehansi, va dya ni ku nwa, va sungula ku endla swilo swo ka swi nga tivikani.	And they rose up early the next day and offered burnt offerings and brought peace offerings. And the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe: Hatlisa u rhelela, hikuva vanhu va wena lava u va humeseke etikweni ra Egipta va tinyamisile, va ndzi dyohela.	And the LORD said to Moses, Go down, for your people, whom you brought up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves.
Va hambukile hi ku hatlisa endleleni leyi ndzi nga va lerisa yona; va tivumberile xifaniso xa rhole, va xi nkhinsamela ni ku xi humesela magandzelo, va ku: ‘N'wina Vaisraele, hi lexi Xikwembu xa n'wina lexi xi mi humeseke etikweni ra Egipta.’ 	They have turned aside quickly out of the way that I commanded them. They have made for themselves a golden calf and have worshiped it and sacrificed to it and said, 'These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!'
HOSI Xikwembu xi engeta xi ku ka Muxe: Vanhu lava ndzi va vonile leswaku va tinonon'hwisa	And the LORD said to Moses, I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stiff-necked people.
sweswi, ndzi tshike ndzi pfurhisa vukari bya mina ehenhla ka vona, ndzi va herisa; kambe wena, ndzi ta ku endla tiko lerikulu.	Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may burn hot against them and I may consume them, in order that I may make a great nation of you.
Kambe Muxe a kombela HOSI Xikwembu hi matimba, a ku: We HOSI, hikwalaho ka yini vukari bya wena byi pfurhela vanhu va wena lava u va humeseke etikweni ra Egipta hi matimba lamakulu ni voko leri tiyeke, xana?	But Moses implored the LORD his God and said, O LORD, why does your wrath burn hot against your people, whom you have brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?
Xana Vaegipta a va nga vuli va ku: ‘Xikwembu xi humesile Vaisraele xi ri ni makungu yo biha ya ku ya va lovisela etintshaveni, xi va herisela makumu emisaveni’ xana? Tshika vukari bya wena lebyo chavisa, u tlhela emakungwini ya wena yo endla swo biha eka vanhu va wena.	Why should the Egyptians say, 'With evil intent did he bring them out, to kill them in the mountains and to consume them from the face of the earth'? Turn from your burning anger and relent from this disaster against your people.
Tsundzuka malandza ya wena Abrahama, na Isaka, na Yakobo lava wena hi xiviri xa wena u va tshembiseke hi ku hlambanya, u ku: ‘Ndzi ta andzisa vatukulu va n'wina va tala ku fana ni tinyeleti, na rona tiko hinkwaro leri ndzi ri tshembiseke ndzi ta ri nyika vatukulu va n'wina, ri va ndzhaka ya vona hilaha ku nga heriki.’ 	Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom you swore by your own self, and said to them, 'I will multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have promised I will give to your offspring, and they shall inherit it forever.'
Hiloko HOSI Xikwembu xi tlhela emakungwini lawa a xi ma vurile, ya ku endla leswo biha eka vanhu va xona.	And the LORD relented from the disaster that he had spoken of bringing on his people.
Kavaloko Muxe a suka entshaveni a rhelela, a khomile maribye mambirhi ya Ntwanano, ma nga maribye ya swiphepherhele lawa a ma tsariwile matlhelo hinkwawo, hala ni hala.	Then Moses turned and went down from the mountain with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand, tablets that were written on both sides; on the front and on the back they were written.
Maribye lawa, a ma endliwile hi HOSI Xikwembu, ni leswi a swi tsariwile ehenhla ka wona hi ku kevetla, a swi tsariwile hi xona.	The tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets.
Loko Yoxuwa a twa huwa ya vanhu lava a va ri karhi va hokoloka, a ku ka Muxe: Ku ni huwa ya nyimpi emixaxeni.	When Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.
Kambe Muxe a hlamula a ku: Leswi mina ndzi twaka swona a hi mpfumawulo wa ku giya ka vahluri, naswona a hi huwa ya mikhosi ya lava hluriweke, kambe i mpfumawulo wa ku yimbelela.	But he said, It is not the sound of shouting for victory, or the sound of the cry of defeat, but the sound of singing that I hear.
Kan'we-kan'we loko Muxe a fika kusuhi ni mixaxa, a vona xifaniso xa rhole ni ku cina ka vanhu, kutani a pfurha hi vukari, a cukumeta maribye lawa a a ma khomile, ma fayekela kwala hansi ka ntshava.	And as soon as he came near the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, Moses' anger burned hot, and he threw the tablets out of his hands and broke them at the foot of the mountain.
Kutani Muxe a teka xifaniso xa rhole lexi a va xi vumbile, a xi hisa, a xi sila xi hundzuka mapa, a haxa mapa lawa ehenhla ka mati, a nwisa Vaisraele.	He took the calf that they had made and burned it with fire and ground it to powder and scattered it on the water and made the people of Israel drink it.
Kutani Muxe a vutisa Aroni a ku: Xana vanhu lava va ku endlile yini, lero kala u va vangela xidyoho xo kurisa leswi, xana?	And Moses said to Aaron, What did this people do to you that you have brought such a great sin upon them?
Aroni a hlamula a ku: We n'wini wanga, u nga tshuki u kariha ku tlula mpimo; wa va tiva vanhu lava leswaku va bihile ngopfu.	And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord burn hot. You know the people, that they are set on evil.
Hi vona va nga te eka mina: ‘Hi endlele xikwembu lexi xi nga ta hi rhangela emahlweni, hikuva a hi tivi leswaku Muxe wa kona loyi a hi suseke etikweni ra Egipta, ú helele kwihi.’	For they said to me, 'Make us gods who shall go before us. As for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.'
Mina ndzi va hlamurile ndzi ku: ‘Un'wana ni un'wana loyi a nga ni xilo xa nsuku, a a xi humese.’ Hiloko va swi tisa eka mina, kutani mina ndzi swi hoxa endzilweni, kwalaho ko tshuka ku humile rhole leri!	So I said to them, 'Let any who have gold take it off.' So they gave it to me, and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf.
Kutani Muxe a swi vona leswaku vanhu va sungurile ku hambuka endleleni, hikuva Aroni a a nga va sivelanga, kutani va tihundzula swihlekiso exikarhi ka valala va vona.	And when Moses saw that the people had broken loose (for Aaron had let them break loose, to the derision of their enemies)
Kutani Muxe a ya yima enyangweni ya mixaxa, a ku: Lava yimaka na HOSI Xikwembu, a va te haleno ka mina! Kutani Valevhi hinkwavo va ya va ya hlengeletana eka Muxe.	then Moses stood in the gate of the camp and said, Who is on the LORD's side? Come to me. And all the sons of Levi gathered around him.
Muxe a ku ka vona: HOSI, Xikwembu xa Israele, xi vurisa sweswo xi ri: ‘Khweketani mabanga ya n'wina hinkwenu ematsheveni, kutani mi rhendzeleka na mixaxa, mi ya fika enyangweni liya, un'wana ni un'wana wa n'wina a dlaya hambi makwavo, kumbe nakulobye, kumbe muakelani wa yena.’ 	And he said to them, Thus says the LORD God of Israel, 'Put your sword on your side each of you, and go to and fro from gate to gate throughout the camp, and each of you kill his brother and his companion and his neighbor.'
Kutani Valevhi va endla hilaha Muxe a leriseke hakona; siku rero ku dlayiwa vavanuna va kwalomu ka 3 000 exikarhi ka Vaisraele.	And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses. And that day about three thousand men of the people fell.
Kutani Muxe a ku: Namuntlha mi vekiwile hinkwenu entirhweni wa HOSI Xikwembu, hi ku herisa vutomi bya vana va n'wina ni bya vamakwenu, kutani sweswo swi mi tiserile minkateko ya HOSI.	And Moses said, Today you have been ordained for the service of the LORD, each one at the cost of his son and of his brother, so that he might bestow a blessing upon you this day.
Siku leri tlhandlamaka, Muxe a byela Vaisraele, a ku: Xidyoho lexi mi xi endleke i xikulu ngopfu. Kutani sweswi ndzi ta tlhandluka ndzi ya eka HOSI Xikwembu entshaveni; kumbexana ndzi nga mi kumela ku rivaleriwa ka xidyoho xa n'wina.	The next day Moses said to the people, You have sinned a great sin. And now I will go up to the LORD; perhaps I can make atonement for your sin.
Kutani Muxe a tlhelela eka HOSI Xikwembu, a fika a ku: Oho, vanhu lava va endlile xidyoho lexikulu ngopfu! Va tivumberile xikwembu xa nsuku!	So Moses returned to the LORD and said, Alas, this people has sinned a great sin. They have made for themselves gods of gold.
Kambe sweswi wa nga va rivalela ku dyoha ka vona; loko u nga swi tsakeli, sula vito ra mina ebukwini leyi u tsaleke mavito ya vanhu va wena eka yona.	But now, if you will forgive their sin—but if not, please blot me out of your book that you have written.
Kambe HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe: Ebukwini ya mina, ndzi ta sula ntsena vito ra loyi a ndzi dyoheleke.	But the LORD said to Moses, Whoever has sinned against me, I will blot out of my book.
Sweswi tlhela, u ya yisa Vaisraele lomu ndzi ku byeleke ku va yisa kona; ntsumi ya mina yi ta mi rhangela emahlweni, kambe siku mina ndzi nga ta va tela, ndzi ta va ba hikwalaho ka xidyoho lexi va nga na xona.	But now go, lead the people to the place about which I have spoken to you; behold, my angel shall go before you. Nevertheless, in the day when I visit, I will visit their sin upon them.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi va ba hi ku va rhumela ntungu, hikuva a va tiendlerile xifaniso xa rhole, xi nga lexi xi vumbiweke hi Aroni.	Then the LORD sent a plague on the people, because they made the calf, the one that Aaron made.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe: Sweswi, suka laha ndhawini leyi, wena ni vanhu lava u va humeseke etikweni ra Egipta, mi ya etikweni leri ndzi ri tshembiseke Abrahama, na Isaka, na Yakobo hi ku hlambanya, ndzi ku ka vona: ‘Tiko leri ndzi ta ri nyika vatukulu va n'wana.’	The LORD said to Moses, Depart; go up from here, you and the people whom you have brought up out of the land of Egypt, to the land of which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, 'To your offspring I will give it.'
Ndzi ta rhumela ntsumi leyi yi nga ta mi rhangela emahlweni; ndzi ta hlongola Vakanana, ni Vaamori, ni Vahiti, ni Vaperesi, ni Vahivhi, ni Vayebusi.	I will send an angel before you, and I will drive out the Canaanites, the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.
Tiko leri mi yaka eka rona ri khuluka ntswamba ni vulombe; kambe mina a ndzi nga fambi exikarhi ka n'wina, hikuva leswi mi nga vanhu lava tinonon'hwisaka, ndzi nga tshuka ndzi mi herisela makumu endleleni.	Go up to a land flowing with milk and honey; but I will not go up among you, lest I consume you on the way, for you are a stiff-necked people.
Loko vanhu va twa timhaka leti to tika leti, va tlhaveka timbilu, ku pfumaleka ni un'we loyi a ambaleke swo tibombisa ha swona.	When the people heard this disastrous word, they mourned, and no one put on his ornaments.
HOSI Xikwembu a xi byerile Muxe xi ku: Tivisa Vaisraele leswaku ndzi ri: ‘Mi vanhu lava omeke tinhloko; loko ndzo tshuka ndzi fambile na n'wina nkarhinyana, ndzi nga mi herisela makumu. Hikokwalaho, hluvulani leswi mi tibombisaka ha swona, mina ndzi ta vona leswi ndzi nga ta endla swona hi n'wina.’ 	For the LORD had said to Moses, Say to the people of Israel, 'You are a stiff-necked people; if for a single moment I should go up among you, I would consume you. So now take off your ornaments, that I may know what to do with you.'
Kutani Vaisraele va hluvula swo tibombisa ha swona; a va ha swi ambalanga, ku sukela entshaveni ya Horebe, ni ku ya emahlweni.	Therefore the people of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments, from Mount Horeb onward.
Enkarhini lowu, Muxe a a toloverile ku teka ntsonga, a ya wu vamba ehandle kule ni mixaxa, a wu thya vito a ku i Ntsonga-wo-hlangana-na-HOSI. Kutani un'wana ni un'wana loyi a a lava ku vutisa timhaka eka HOSI Xikwembu, a a huma a ya eka ntsonga lowu, ehandle ka mixaxa.	Now Moses used to take the tent and pitch it outside the camp, far off from the camp, and he called it the tent of meeting. And everyone who sought the LORD would go out to the tent of meeting, which was outside the camp.
Minkarhi hinkwayo, loko Muxe a huma emixaxeni a ya entsongeni lowu, vanhu hinkwavo a va suka va yima, un'wana ni un'wana enyangweni ya nxaxa wa yena, va languta Muxe a kondza a nghena entsongeni.	Whenever Moses went out to the tent, all the people would rise up, and each would stand at his tent door, and watch Moses until he had gone into the tent.
Loko Muxe a nghenile entsongeni, papa ri nembelela, ri fika ri yima enyangweni ya ntsonga, kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi vulavula na yena.	When Moses entered the tent, the pillar of cloud would descend and stand at the entrance of the tent, and the LORD would speak with Moses.
Kutani loko vanhu va vona papa rero enyangweni ya ntsonga, a va nkhinsama hinkwavo va khongela, un'wana ni un'wana a ri enyangweni ya nxaxa wa yena.	And when all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance of the tent, all the people would rise up and worship, each at his tent door.
Hi ndlela leyi, HOSI Xikwembu a xi hamba xi vulavula na Muxe xi n'wi langutile, ku fana ni munhu loko a vulavula ni nakulobye. Minkarhi hinkwayo loko Muxe a tlhelela emixaxeni, jaha leri a ri n'wi pfuna, a nga yena Yoxuwa n'wana Nuni, a ri sala kwale ntsongeni.	Thus the LORD used to speak to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend. When Moses turned again into the camp, his assistant Joshua the son of Nun, a young man, would not depart from the tent.
Kutani Muxe a ku ka HOSI Xikwembu: Vona, u te ka mina: ‘Fambisa vanhu lava!’ Kambe a wu ndzi kombanga loyi ndzi nga ta famba na yena; kasi u vurile hi wexe leswaku wa ndzi tiva swinene, ni leswaku wa ndzi tsakela.	Moses said to the LORD, See, you say to me, 'Bring up this people,' but you have not let me know whom you will send with me. Yet you have said, 'I know you by name, and you have also found favor in my sight.'
Hikokwalaho, loko hakunene u ndzi tsakela, ndzi kombela leswaku u ndzi komba makungu ya wena, ndzi ta kota ku ku tiva, ndzi kota ni ku ku tsakisa; naswona tsundzuka leswaku vanhu lava, hi rona tiko ra wena.	Now therefore, if I have found favor in your sight, please show me now your ways, that I may know you in order to find favor in your sight. Consider too that this nation is your people.
Hiloko HOSI Xikwembu xi ku: Mina hi ndzexe ndzi ta famba na n'wina, ndzi mi yisa lomu mi nga ta tshamiseka kona.	And he said, My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.
Kutani Muxe a ku ka HOSI Xikwembu: Loko wena hi wexe u ta ka u nga fambi na hina, hi tshike kwala, u nga hi susi exivandleni lexi.	And he said to him, If your presence will not go with me, do not bring us up from here.
Loko u nga fambi na hina, xana swi ta vonaka hi mukhuva wihi leswaku mina ni vanhu va wena wa hi tsakela xana? Mhaka leyi endlaka leswaku hi va vanhu lava hlawuriweke exikarhi ka hinkwavo lava hanyaka emisaveni, xana a hi leswi wena u fambaka na hina xana?	For how shall it be known that I have found favor in your sight, I and your people? Is it not in your going with us, so that we are distinct, I and your people, from every other people on the face of the earth?
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe: Mhaka leyi u yi kombelaka, ndzi ta yi endla, hikuva ndza ku tsakela, naswona ndza ku tiva swinene.	And the LORD said to Moses, This very thing that you have spoken I will do, for you have found favor in my sight, and I know you by name.
Kutani Muxe a ku: Ndzi kombela leswaku u ndzi komba ku vonakala ka wena.	Moses said, Please show me your glory.
HOSI Xikwembu xi hlamula xi ku: Ndzi ta hundza hi le mahlweni ka wena ndzi ri karhi ndzi ku komba vunene bya mina hinkwabyo, ndzi twarisa vito ra mina ra ‘HOSI’ emahlweni ka wena. Ndzi ta komba tintswalo eka lava ndzi nga ta va komba tona, ndzi twela vusiwana lava ndzi nga ta va twela byona.	And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before you and will proclaim before you my name 'The LORD.' And I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy.
Xi engeta xi ku: Loko wu ri mombo wa mina wona, u nga ka u nga wu voni, hikuva a ku na munhu loyi a nga hanyaka, loko a ndzi vona.	But, he said, you cannot see my face, for man shall not see me and live.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku: Vona, ndhawu hi leyi kusuhi na mina, laha u nga ta yima kona, ehenhla ka ribye	And the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me where you shall stand on the rock
loko ndzi hundza hi ku vonakala ka mina, ndzi ta ku nghenisa ebakweni ra ribye, ndzi ku khubumeta hi xandla xa mina; kutani loko ndzi ta va ndzi hundzile	and while my glory passes by I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and I will cover you with my hand until I have passed by.
ndzi ta susa voko ra mina, kutani u ta vona xikosi xa mina, kambe mombo wa mina wona u nga ka u nga wu voni.	Then I will take away my hand, and you shall see my back, but my face shall not be seen.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe: Vatla maribye mambirhi ya swiphepherhele, ma fana ni layo sungula; kutani mina ndzi ta tsala kambe marito lawa a ma ri eka maribye layo sungula, lawa u ma fayeke.	The LORD said to Moses, Cut for yourself two tablets of stone like the first, and I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke.
Mundzuku nimpundzu u fanele ku va u hetile; kutani loko ri xa, tlhandlukela ehenhla ka ntshava ya Sinayi, u fika u ndzi yimela kona.	Be ready by the morning, and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai, and present yourself there to me on the top of the mountain.
Ku nga vi ni munhu ni un'we loyi a nga ta tlhandluka na wena, naswona ku nga vi ni un'we loyi a nga ta kumiwa a ri exivandleni xihi ni xihi xa ntshava; hambi swi ri swifuwo leswikulu ni leswitsongo, swi nga tshuki swi dyela kusuhi ni ntshava.	No one shall come up with you, and let no one be seen throughout all the mountain. Let no flocks or herds graze opposite that mountain.
Kutani Muxe a vatla maribye mambirhi ya swiphepherhele, ma fana ni layo sungula; a pfuka nimpundzu swinene, a tlhandlukela entshaveni ya Sinayi hilaha HOSI Xikwembu xi n'wi leriseke hakona, a famba a khomile maribye lawa mambirhi.	So Moses cut two tablets of stone like the first. And he rose early in the morning and went up on Mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand two tablets of stone.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi rhelela xi ri epapeni, xi fika xi yima na Muxe kwale ntshaveni, xi twarisa vito ra xona, ra HOSI.	The LORD descended in the cloud and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD.
Kutani xi hundza hi le mahlweni ka Muxe, xi ri karhi xi huwelela, xi ku: HOSI, HOSI, Xikwembu lexi twelaka vanhu vusiwana ni ku va tsetselela, lexi hlwelaka ku kariha, lexi taleke tintswalo ni ku tshembeka	The LORD passed before him and proclaimed, The LORD, the LORD, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness
lexi kombaka tintswalo leti to tshembeka ku fika eka rixaka ra khume ra madzana, lexi rivalelaka milandzu, ni ku tiarisa, ni swidyoho, kambe xi nga tshikiki ku ba lava dyoheke, ku fika eka vana va vona, ni ka vatukulu va vona ku yisa erixakeni ra vunharhu ni ra vumune.	keeping steadfast love for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but who will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children and the children's children, to the third and the fourth generation.
Kutani Muxe a korhamela hansi hi ku hatlisa, a khongela	And Moses quickly bowed his head toward the earth and worshiped.
a ku: HOSI, loko hakunene u ndzi tsakela, ndzi kombela leswaku u famba exikarhi ka hina, we HOSI! Hambileswi vanhu lava va tinonon'hwisaka, hi rivalele nandzu wa hina ni xidyoho xa hina, u hi endla vanhu va wena va xiviri.	And he said, If now I have found favor in your sight, O Lord, please let the Lord go in the midst of us, for it is a stiff-necked people, and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for your inheritance.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku: Sweswi ndzi le ku endleni ka ntwanano ni Vaisraele. Ndzi ta endla swihlamariso leswikulu emahlweni ka vanhu va wena; swihlamariso swa kona a swi si tshama swi humelela emisaveni hinkwayo, kumbe erixakeni rihi na rihi. Vanhu va matiko hinkwawo lawa ya mi rhendzeleke, va ta vona leswi mina HOSI ndzi tirhaka swona, hikuva leswi ndzi nga ta mi endlela swona, swi ta chavisa ngopfu.	And he said, Behold, I am making a covenant. Before all your people I will do marvels, such as have not been created in all the earth or in any nation. And all the people among whom you are shall see the work of the LORD, for it is an awesome thing that I will do with you.
Hlayisani leswi ndzi mi lerisaka swona namuntlha. Mina ndzi ta hlongola Vaamori, ni Vakanana, ni Vahiti, ni Vaperesi, ni Vahivhi, ni Vayebusi, va suka emahlweni ka n'wina.	Observe what I command you this day. Behold, I will drive out before you the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.
Mi tivonela, mi nga tshuki mi endla ntwanano ni vaaki va tiko leri mi yaka eka rona, hikuva mhaka leyi yi nga hundzuka ntlhamu lowu wu nga ta mi phasa.	Take care, lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land to which you go, lest it become a snare in your midst.
Mi ta hindzimuxa tialitari ta vona, mi fayetela ni maribye ya vukhongeri bya vona bya hava, mi tsemelela ni timhandze ta Axera xikwembukazi xa vona.	You shall tear down their altars and break their pillars and cut down their Asherim
Mi nga tshuki mi nkhinsamela swikwembu swin'wana, hikuva mina HOSI, vito ra mina hi mina Xikwembu-xa-rilaveta, ndzi Xikwembu lexi lavaka ku gandzeriwa xi ri xoxe ntsena.	(for you shall worship no other god, for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God)
Mi nga tshuki mi endla ntwanano ni vaaki va tiko, hikuva loko va ri karhi va endla vunghwavava eku gandzeleni ka swikwembu swa vona, ni loko va swi humesela magandzelo, va nga tshuka va mi rhambile, kutani mi dya swa magandzelo ya vona	lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and when they whore after their gods and sacrifice to their gods and you are invited, you eat of his sacrifice
naswona mi nga tshuki mi lavela majaha ya n'wina evasati exikarhi ka vanhu lava, hikuva vavasati lava va ta ya emahlweni va endla vunghwavava eku gandzeleni ka swikwembu swa vona, va kokela ni vana va n'wina eka swona.	and you take of their daughters for your sons, and their daughters whore after their gods and make your sons whore after their gods.
Mi nga tshuki mi n'okisa swilo mi tiendlela swifaniso swa swikwembu.	You shall not make for yourself any gods of cast metal.
Mi ta endla nkhuvo wa Xinkwa lexo-ke-comela, hilaha ndzi mi leriseke hakona. Mi fanele ku dya xinkwa lexo-ke-comela masiku ya 7, hi nkarhi lowu vekiweke eka n'hweti ya Abibi, hikuva hi yona n'hweti leyi mi humeke ha yona etikweni ra Egipta.	You shall keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, at the time appointed in the month Abib, for in the month Abib you came out from Egypt.
Hinkwaswo leswi rhangeke ku velekiwa i swa mina; mi ndzi hlawulela ni mativula ya swifuwo swa n'wina hinkwaswo, leswikulu ni leswitsongo.	All that open the womb are mine, all your male livestock, the firstborn of cow and sheep.
Ematshan'weni ya ximbhongolwana xa xinuna xa mativula, mi ta tlhava xinyimpfana kumbe ximbutana; loko mi nga tsakeli ku tlhava nchumu ematshan'weni ya ximbhongolwana, xi tshoveni nhamu; kambe ematshan'weni ya vana va n'wina hinkwavo va xinuna va mativula, mi ta tlhava xifuwo.
Ku nga vi na munhu loyi a taka emahlweni ka mina, a nga tamelanga nchumu.	The firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb, or if you will not redeem it you shall break its neck. All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem. And none shall appear before me empty-handed.
Mi ni masiku ya 6 lawa mi faneleke ku tirha ha wona, kambe hi siku ra vu-7 mi ta wisa, hambiloko wu ri nkarhi wa xirimo, kumbe nkarhi wa ntshovelo.	Six days you shall work, but on the seventh day you shall rest. In plowing time and in harvest you shall rest.
Mi ta endla Nkhuvo wa Mavhiki, mi humesa ntshovelo wo sungula wa koroni; kasi eku heleni ka nkarhi wa ntshovelo, mi ta endla Nkhuvo wo Hlengeleta.	You shall observe the Feast of Weeks, the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the Feast of Ingathering at the year's end.
Vavanuna va ka n'wina hinkwavo va fanele ku hlengeletana kanharhu hi lembe emahlweni ka mina HOSI N'wini wa hinkwaswo, Xikwembu xa Israele.	Three times in the year shall all your males appear before the LORD God, the God of Israel.
Ndzi ta hlongola vamatiko emahlweni ka n'wina, ndzi kurisa tiko ra n'wina, kutani enkarhini lowu mi nga ta ta mi ta hlengeletana emahlweni ka mina kanharhu elembeni, a ku nga vi na munhu loyi a nga ta sala a ringeta ku mi tekela tiko.	For I will cast out nations before you and enlarge your borders; no one shall covet your land, when you go up to appear before the LORD your God three times in the year.
Loko mi ndzi tlhavela magandzelo, mi nga tshuki mi katsa ngati ya xifuwo ni xinkwa lexi nga ni comela; naswona, loko mi humesa magandzelo enkhubyeni wa Paseka, ku nga tshuki ku va ni leswi nga ta tshama ku fikela nimpundzu.	You shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with anything leavened, or let the sacrifice of the Feast of the Passover remain until the morning.
Leswi mi nga ta rhanga mi swi tshovela eka ntshovelo wo sungula wa le masin'wini ya n'wina, mi ta swi tisa endlwini ya mina HOSI, Xikwembu xa n'wina.
Mi nga tshuki mi sweka ximbutana hi masi ya mana wa xona.	The best of the firstfruits of your ground you shall bring to the house of the LORD your God. You shall not boil a young goat in its mother's milk.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe: Tsala marito lawa, hikuva ndzi bohile ntwanano na wena na Vaisraele, hi ku landza wona.	And the LORD said to Moses, Write these words, for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.
Muxe ú tshamile na HOSI Xikwembu kwale ntshaveni masiku ya 40 ni vusiku bya kona, a nga dyi nchumu, a nga nwi nchumu; kutani a tsala marito ya ntwanano, yi nga Milawu ya khume, emaribyeni ya swiphepherhele.	So he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights. He neither ate bread nor drank water. And he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the Ten Commandments.
Loko Muxe a ri karhi a rhelela a ta hi le ntshaveni ya Sinayi, a khomile maribye lawa mambirhi ya Ntwanano, a a nga swi tivi leswaku mombo wa yena wa hatima, hi mhaka ya leswi a vulavuleke na HOSI Xikwembu.	When Moses came down from Mount Sinai, with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand as he came down from the mountain, Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone because he had been talking with God.
Loko Aroni ni Vaisraele hinkwavo va languta Muxe, va vona mombo wa yena wu hatima, kutani va chava ku ta kusuhi na yena.	Aaron and all the people of Israel saw Moses, and behold, the skin of his face shone, and they were afraid to come near him.
Kambe Muxe a va vitana, kutani Aroni ni varhangeri hinkwavo va ntshungu wa Vaisraele va ya kusuhi na yena, kutani Muxe a vulavula na vona.	But Moses called to them, and Aaron and all the leaders of the congregation returned to him, and Moses talked with them.
Endzhaku ka sweswo, na vona Vaisraele hinkwavo va ta kusuhi, kutani a va tivisa milawu hinkwayo leyi HOSI Xikwembu xi n'wi byeleke yona loko a ri entshaveni ya Sinayi.	Afterward all the people of Israel came near, and he commanded them all that the LORD had spoken with him in Mount Sinai.
Loko Muxe a hetile ku vulavula na vona, a siva mombo wa yena hi xincekana.	And when Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil over his face.
Kambe nkarhi hinkwawo loko Muxe a nghena entsongeni ku ya vulavula na HOSI Xikwembu, a a susa xincekana emombyeni, ku kondza loko a huma. Loko Muxe a suka emahlweni ka HOSI Xikwembu, a ya tivisa Vaisraele leswi xi n'wi leriseke swona	Whenever Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he would remove the veil, until he came out. And when he came out and told the people of Israel what he was commanded
Vaisraele a va vona mombo wa yena wu ri karhi wu hatima; hikokwalaho, a a tisiva mombo hi xincekana, ku kondza loko a tlhelela entsongeni ku ya vulavula na HOSI Xikwembu.	the people of Israel would see the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face was shining. And Moses would put the veil over his face again, until he went in to speak with him.
Kutani Muxe a vitana ntshungu hinkwawo wa Vaisraele, a ku ka vona: Leswi HOSI Xikwembu xi mi leriseke ku swi endla, hi leswi	Moses assembled all the congregation of the people of Israel and said to them, These are the things that the LORD has commanded you to do.
Ku ta tirhiwa hi masiku ya 6, kambe eka n'wina, siku ra vu-7 ri ta va leri hlawulekeke ra ku wisa, siku ra Savata leri hlawuleriweke HOSI Xikwembu; un'wana ni un'wana loyi a nga ta tirha hi siku leri, ú faneriwile hi ku fa.	Six days work shall be done, but on the seventh day you shall have a Sabbath of solemn rest, holy to the LORD. Whoever does any work on it shall be put to death.
Hambi wu ri ndzilo, mi nga tshuki mi wu tshivela emitini ya n'wina, hi siku leri ra Savata.	You shall kindle no fire in all your dwelling places on the Sabbath day.
Kutani Muxe a byela nhlengeletano hinkwayo ya Vaisraele, a ku: Leswi HOSI Xikwembu xi nga lerisa swona hi leswi	Moses said to all the congregation of the people of Israel, This is the thing that the LORD has commanded.
Vanhu hinkwavo exikarhi ka n'wina lava tinyiketaka ku humesela HOSI Xikwembu enhlengo hi mbilu yo basa, a va tise leswi: Nsuku, ni silivhere, ni koporo	Take from among you a contribution to the LORD. Whoever is of a generous heart, let him bring the LORD's contribution: gold, silver, and bronze

Kutani ntshungu hinkwawo wa Vaisraele wu suka emahlweni ka Muxe, wu hangalaka.	Then all the congregation of the people of Israel departed from the presence of Moses.
Kutani hinkwavo lava tinyiketeke ku tirha, va ta; naswona hinkwavo lava tinyiketeke hi moya lowu ntshunxekeke, va ta va tisa mihlengo ya HOSI Xikwembu ya ku endla Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka, ni ya leswi tirhisiwaka eku gandzeleni, ku katsa ni swiambalo leswo hlawuleka.	And they came, everyone whose heart stirred him, and everyone whose spirit moved him, and brought the LORD's contribution to be used for the tent of meeting, and for all its service, and for the holy garments.
Ku ta vavanuna ni vavasati, hinkwavo va ri lava tinyiketeke hi mbilu yo basa, va tisa swipereta, ni swingwavila swa le tindleveni ni swa le tintihweni, ni masindza, ni swilo swa tinxaka-xaka swa nsuku; un'wana ni un'wana a nyiketa nhlengo wa yena wa nsuku, yi va nyiko leyo hlawuleka eka HOSI Xikwembu.	So they came, both men and women. All who were of a willing heart brought brooches and earrings and signet rings and armlets, all sorts of gold objects, every man dedicating an offering of gold to the LORD.
Un'wana ni un'wana loyi a a ri ni voya bya tinyimpfu bya muhlovo wa rihlaza ra tilo, kumbe wa xivunguvungu, kumbe lowo tshwuka, kumbe loyi a a ri ni ntsembyani lowo saseka, kumbe voya bya timbuti, kumbe madzovo ya tinyimpfu lama tlhuvutsiweke, kumbe madzovo ya timbuti, a a swi tisa.	And every one who possessed blue or purple or scarlet yarns or fine linen or goats' hair or tanned rams' skins or goatskins brought them.
Un'wana ni un'wana loyi a a kota ku humesa silivhere kumbe koporo, a a tisa swona wu va nhlengo wa yena eka HOSI Xikwembu; naswona un'wana ni un'wana loyi a a ri ni mapulangi ya murhi wa munga lama nga tirhaka ntirho wihi na wihi, a a ma humesa.	Everyone who could make a contribution of silver or bronze brought it as the LORD's contribution. And every one who possessed acacia wood of any use in the work brought it.
Vavasati lava a va ri ni vutivi bya ku swula, a va tisa leswi va swi swuleke hi voya bya muhlovo wa rihlaza ra tilo, ni wa xivunguvungu, ni lowo tshwuka, ni ntsembyani lowo saseka.	And every skillful woman spun with her hands, and they all brought what they had spun in blue and purple and scarlet yarns and fine twined linen.
Naswona vavasati hinkwavo lava va tinyiketeleke ku tirha, a va swula ni voya bya timbuti.	All the women whose hearts stirred them to use their skill spun the goats' hair.
Varhangeri vona a va tisa maribye ya onikisi ya nkoka, ni lama nga ta vekeriwa engubyeni ya vuprista ya efodi ni le xincekaneni xa kona xa le xifuveni	And the leaders brought onyx stones and stones to be set, for the ephod and for the breastpiece
a va tisa ni mirhi yo nun'hwerisa, ni mafurha yo voninga, ni swo nun'hwerisa mafurha yo tola, ni swinun'hweriso swa mirhi ya risuna leyi hisiwaka egandzelweni.	and spices and oil for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the fragrant incense.
Vaisraele hinkwavo, vavanuna ni vavasati, lava tinyiketeke hi mbilu yo basa, va tisa xilo xin'wana ni xin'wana lexi nga ta pfuna entirhweni lowu HOSI Xikwembu xi leriseke Muxe leswaku wu endliwa, un'wana ni un'wana a humesela HOSI Xikwembu a ntshunxekile.	All the men and women, the people of Israel, whose heart moved them to bring anything for the work that the LORD had commanded by Moses to be done brought it as a freewill offering to the LORD.
Kutani Muxe a ku ka Vaisraele: Vonani, HOSI Xikwembu xi hlawurile Besalele n'wana Uri wa Huru, wa nyimba ya Yuda	Then Moses said to the people of Israel, See, the LORD has called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah
xi n'wi cherile Moya wa xona, xi n'wi nyika vutlhari, ni ku twisisa, ni vutivi, ni ku kota mintirho hinkwayo	and he has filled him with the Spirit of God, with skill, with intelligence, with knowledge, and with all craftsmanship
leswaku a endla swilo leswo saseka hi ku tirhisa nsuku, ni silivhere, ni koporo	to devise artistic designs, to work in gold and silver and bronze
ú ta kota ni ku vatla maribye, a ma vekela eka swikhomiso, a kevetla ni mapulangi, a tirha ni mintirho yo sasekisa ya tinxaka-xaka.	in cutting stones for setting, and in carving wood, for work in every skilled craft.
Naswona, HOSI Xikwembu xi n'wi nyikile vutivi byo kota ku dyondzisa van'wana, xi nyika na Oholiyabu n'wana Ahisamaki, wa nyimba ya Dani.	And he has inspired him to teach, both him and Oholiab the son of Ahisamach of the tribe of Dan.
HOSI Xikwembu xi va nyikile vutlhari bya ku kota ku tirha ntirho wun'wana ni wun'wana, ku fana ni ku vatla, kumbe ku sasekisa swilo, kumbe ku rhungelela mavalavala hi voya bya muhlovo wa rihlaza ra tilo, ni wa xivunguvungu, ni lowo tshwuka, ni ntsembyani wo saseka lowu lukiweke, hambi wu ri ntirho wo luka kunene, kumbe mintirho yin'wana ya tinxaka-xaka, ku katsa ni vutivi byo sasekisa swilo.	He has filled them with skill to do every sort of work done by an engraver or by a designer or by an embroiderer in blue and purple and scarlet yarns and fine twined linen, or by a weaver—by any sort of workman or skilled designer.
Kutani Besalele na Oholiyabu ni vavanuna hinkwavo lava nga ni vutivi bya ntirho, lava HOSI Xikwembu xi va nyikeke vutlhari ni ku twisisa, ni ku kota mintirho hinkwayo eku endleni ka xivandla lexo hlawuleka, va ta tirha hi ku landza hinkwaswo leswi HOSI Xikwembu xi leriseke swona.	Bezalel and Oholiab and every craftsman in whom the LORD has put skill and intelligence to know how to do any work in the construction of the sanctuary shall work in accordance with all that the LORD has commanded.
Kutani Muxe a vitana Besalele na Oholiyabu, ni vavanuna hinkwavo lava nga ni vutivi bya ntirho, lava HOSI Xikwembu xi va nyikeke miehleketo ya vutlhari, ni hinkwavo lava tinyiketeleke ku tirha, leswaku va ta, va ta nghena entirhweni.	And Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab and every craftsman in whose mind the LORD had put skill, everyone whose heart stirred him up to come to do the work.
Kwalaho Muxe a veka emavokweni ya vona mihlengo hinkwayo leyi Vaisraele va yi humeseke, leswaku yi ta pfuna entirhweni wa ku endla xivandla lexo hlawuleka, kambe Vaisraele a va ya emahlweni va tisa mihlengo ya vona eka Muxe, mpundzu wun'wana ni wun'wana.	And they received from Moses all the contribution that the people of Israel had brought for doing the work on the sanctuary. They still kept bringing him freewill offerings every morning
Hiloko vatirhi hinkwavo lava tivaka ntirho lava a va ri entirhweni exivandleni lexo hlawuleka, va suka lomu a va tirha kona, va ta eka Muxe	so that all the craftsmen who were doing every sort of task on the sanctuary came, each from the task that he was doing
va fika va ku ka yena: Vanhu va tisa swilo leswo tala ku tlula leswi swi lavekaka entirhweni lowu HOSI Xikwembu xi hi leriseke ku wu endla!	and said to Moses, The people bring much more than enough for doing the work that the LORD has commanded us to do.
Hiloko Muxe a rhumela xileriso emixaxeni hinkwayo, a ku: Ku nga vi na loyi a ha tikarhatelaka ku humesa nhlengo wa xivandla lexo hlawuleka, hambi a ri wanuna kumbe wansati. Kutani a yimisa vanhu ku tisa mihlengo.	So Moses gave command, and word was proclaimed throughout the camp, Let no man or woman do anything more for the contribution for the sanctuary. So the people were restrained from bringing
Swilo leswi vatirhi a va ri na swona, a swi ringana ku heta ntirho hinkwawo, swi tlhela swi sala.	for the material they had was sufficient to do all the work, and more.
Kutani vavanuna hinkwavo lava a va ri ni vutivi bya ntirho exikarhi ka vatirhi, va endla Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka hi swisirhelelo swa khume, va swi endla hi ntsembyani wo saseka lowu lukiweke, ni voya bya tinyimpfu bya muhlovo wa rihlaza ra tilo, ni wa xivunguvungu, ni lowo tshwuka, va swi sasekisa hi ku swi rhungelela swifaniso swa tikerubu	And all the craftsmen among the workmen made the tabernacle with ten curtains. They were made of fine twined linen and blue and purple and scarlet yarns, with cherubim skillfully worked.
xisirhelelo xin'wana ni xin'wana a xi ri ni mimpimo leyi: 14 m ku leha ni 2 m ku anama; swisirhelelo hinkwaswo a swi ri ni mimpimo yo ringana.	The length of each curtain was twenty-eight cubits, and the breadth of each curtain four cubits. All the curtains were the same size.
Va hlanganisa ntlhanu wa swisirhelelo, swi endla xin'we; ni leswin'wana swa ntlhanu, va swi hlanganisisa sweswo.	He coupled five curtains to one another, and the other five curtains he coupled to one another.
Nsomo wa xisirhelelo xa le handle, eka swisirhelelo swa ntlhanu leswo sungula, va wu rhungelela marimi hi tingoti ta rihlaza ra tilo; na wona nsomo wa xisirhelelo xa le handle, eka swisirhelelo swa ntlhanu leswa vumbirhi, va wu rhungelela marimi.	He made loops of blue on the edge of the outermost curtain of the first set. Likewise he made them on the edge of the outermost curtain of the second set.
Va rhungelela marimi ya 50 eka nsomo wa xisirhelelo lexo hetelela; marimi lawa a ma langutanile.	He made fifty loops on the one curtain, and he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was in the second set. The loops were opposite one another.
Kutani va endla swikhweketo swa 50 swa nsuku, va khomanisa swisirhelelo hi swona; hi ndlela leyi, Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka wu hlangana wu va xilo xin'we lexi heleleke.	And he made fifty clasps of gold, and coupled the curtains one to the other with clasps. So the tabernacle was a single whole.
Va endla swin'wana swisirhelelo hi voya bya timbuti, swi va swa ntsonga wa vumbirhi ehenhla ka Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka; va endla swisirhelelo leswi swi ri 11.	He also made curtains of goats' hair for a tent over the tabernacle. He made eleven curtains.
Swisirhelelo leswi a swi ri ni mimpimo leyi: 15 m ku leha, ni 2 m ku anama; swisirhelelo leswi swa 11 a swi ri ni mimpimo yo ringana.	The length of each curtain was thirty cubits, and the breadth of each curtain four cubits. The eleven curtains were the same size.
Kutani va hlanganisa ntlhanu wa swisirhelelo swi endla xin'we, ni leswin'wana swa 6 va swi hlanganisisa sweswo.	He coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves.
Nsomo wa xisirhelelo xo sungula eka leswa ntlhanu, va wu rhungelela marimi ya 50, na wona nsomo wa xisirhelelo lexo hetelela eka leswa 6, va wu rhungelela marimi ya 50.	And he made fifty loops on the edge of the outermost curtain of the one set, and fifty loops on the edge of the other connecting curtain.
Kutani va endla swikhweketo swa 50 swa koporo, swo hlanganisa ha swona Ntsonga leswaku wu va xilo xin'we lexi heleleke.	And he made fifty clasps of bronze to couple the tent together that it might be a single whole.
Naswona, va endla xo funengeta Ntsonga hi madzovo lama tlhuvutsiweke ya tinyimpfu ni ya timbuti.	And he made for the tent a covering of tanned rams' skins and goatskins.
Kutani va vatla mapulangi hi murhi wa munga, ya ku yimisa Ntsonga ha wona.	Then he made the upright frames for the tabernacle of acacia wood.
Pulangi rin'wana ni rin'wana a ri ri ni mimpimo leyi: 5 m ku leha, ni 75 cm ku anama.	Ten cubits was the length of a frame, and a cubit and a half the breadth of each frame.
Epulangini rin'wana ni rin'wana a ku ri ni timhingu timbirhi to hlanganisa mapulangi lawa; va endlisa sweswo ni le mapulangini hinkwawo ya Ntsonga.	Each frame had two tenons for fitting together. He did this for all the frames of the tabernacle.
Mapulangi ya Ntsonga, va ma veka hi ndlela leyi: Mapulangi ya 20 a ma ri etlhelo ra le dzongeni.	The frames for the tabernacle he made thus: twenty frames for the south side.
Ehansi ka mapulangi lawa ya 20 va veka minkotloto ya 40 ya silivhere, mimbirhi ehansi ka pulangi rin'we, laha ku nga ta nghena timhingu ta rona timbirhi, ni minkotloto mimbirhi ehansi ka rin'wana pulangi, laha ku nga ta nghena timhingu ta rona timbirhi.	And he made forty bases of silver under the twenty frames, two bases under one frame for its two tenons, and two bases under the next frame for its two tenons.
Etlhelweni lera vumbirhi ra Ntsonga, en'walungwini, a ku ri ni mapulangi ya 20	For the second side of the tabernacle, on the north side, he made twenty frames
ni minkotloto ya wona ya 40 ya silivhere, mimbirhi ehansi ka pulangi rin'we, ni mimbirhi ehansi ka rin'wana pulangi.	and their forty bases of silver, two bases under one frame and two bases under the next frame.
Va veka mapulangi ya 6 endzhaku ka Ntsonga hi tlhelo ra vupeladyambu.	For the rear of the tabernacle westward he made six frames.
Etinhleni ta Ntsonga leta le ndzhaku, va yimisa mapulangi mambirhi.	He made two frames for corners of the tabernacle in the rear.
Mapulangi lawa a ma hambanile ehansi, kambe ehenhla a ma hlanganisiwile exingwavileni lexo sungula. Mapulangi ya tinhla letimbirhi va ma yimisa hi ndlela leyi, mambirhi eyinhleni yin'we.	And they were separate beneath but joined at the top, at the first ring. He made two of them this way for the two corners.
Mapulangi hinkwawo ya le tinhleni a ma ri 8, ma ri ni minkovotlo ya wona ya 16 ya silivhere, mimbirhi ehansi ka pulangi rin'wana ni rin'wana.	There were eight frames with their bases of silver: sixteen bases, under every frame two bases.
Kutani va vatla timhandze to hingakanya ha tona ta murhi wa munga, va ti veka hi ndlela leyi: Ntlhanu wa timhandze a ti hingakanya emapulangwini ya tlhelo rin'we ra Ntsonga	He made bars of acacia wood, five for the frames of the one side of the tabernacle
ntlhanu wa tona ti hingakanya emapulangwini ya tlhelo lerin'wana ra Ntsonga, ni tin'wana ta ntlhanu ti hingakanya emapulangwini lama nga endzhaku ka Ntsonga, hi tlhelo ra vupeladyambu.	and five bars for the frames of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the frames of the tabernacle at the rear westward.
Mhandze ya le xikarhi yo hingakanya mapulangi, va yi veka yi suka emakumu ka Ntsonga, yi ya fika emakumu ka wona.	And he made the middle bar to run from end to end halfway up the frames.
Kutani va nameka nsuku emapulangwini ya Ntsonga, va vekela ni swingwavila swa nsuku, laha timhandze leto hingakanya ha tona ti nga ta tlhomiwa kona; na tona timhandze leti, va ti nameka nsuku.	And he overlaid the frames with gold, and made their rings of gold for holders for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.
Kutani va endla xisirhelelo hi voya bya muhlovo wa rihlaza ra tilo, ni wa xivunguvungu, ni lowo tshwuka, ni ntsembyani wo saseka lowu lukiweke, va xi sasekisa hi ku xi rhungelela swifaniso swa tikerubu.	He made the veil of blue and purple and scarlet yarns and fine twined linen; with cherubim skillfully worked into it he made it.
Xisirhelelo lexi, va xi vatlela mune wa tiphuphu hi murhi wa munga, va ti nameka nsuku; va vekela swikhweketo swa nsuku eka tona, va ti vumbela ni minkotloto ya mune ya silivhere.	And for it he made four pillars of acacia and overlaid them with gold. Their hooks were of gold, and he cast for them four bases of silver.
Naswona va endla xisirhelelo xo pfala nyangwa ya Ntsonga hi voya bya muhlovo wa rihlaza ra tilo, ni wa xivunguvungu, ni lowo tshwuka, ni ntsembyani lowo saseka lowu lukiweke, lowu rhungeleriweke mavalavala	He also made a screen for the entrance of the tent, of blue and purple and scarlet yarns and fine twined linen, embroidered with needlework
va xi vatlela ni ntlhanu wa tiphuphu, ni swikhweketo swa tona; va nameka nsuku etinhlokweni ta tona ni le swimhandzaneni swa tona swa ku hayeka xisirhelelo; kambe minkovotlo ya tona leya ntlhanu yona a yi ri ya koporo.	and its five pillars with their hooks. He overlaid their capitals, and their fillets were of gold, but their five bases were of bronze.
Kutani Besalele a endla Areka hi mapulangi ya murhi wa munga, yi ri ni mimpimo leyi: 125 cm ku leha, ni 75 cm ku anama, ni 75 cm ku ya ehenhla.	Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood. Two cubits and a half was its length, a cubit and a half its breadth, and a cubit and a half its height.
A yi nameka nsuku lowo tenga endzeni ni le handle, a endla nkonye wa nsuku wu rhendzeleka na yona.	And he overlaid it with pure gold inside and outside, and made a molding of gold around it.
Kutani a yi endlela mune wa swingwavila hi nsuku lowu n'okisiweke, a swi vekela emilengeni ya yona ya mune, swimbirhi swi va emilengeni ya tlhelo rin'we, swimbirhi emilengeni ya tlhelo rin'wana.	And he cast for it four rings of gold for its four feet, two rings on its one side and two rings on its other side.
A vatla ni timhandze ta murhi wa munga, a ti nameka nsuku	And he made poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold
kutani a ti tlhoma eswingwavileni leswi nga ematlhelo ya Areka, leswaku ti va swikhomo swo yi rhwala ha swona.	and put the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark to carry the ark.
A endla xitshamu xa ndzivalelo hi nsuku lowu tengeke, xi ri ni mimpimo leyi: 125 cm ku leha ni 75 cm ku anama.	And he made a mercy seat of pure gold. Two cubits and a half was its length, and a cubit and a half its breadth.
A fula tikerubu timbirhi hi nsuku a ti vekela emakumu ka xitshamu xa ndzivalelo	And he made two cherubim of gold. He made them of hammered work on the two ends of the mercy seat
kerubu yin'we etlhelweni rin'wana na rin'wana; tikerubu leti, a ti endla ti khomana ni xitshamu xa ndzivalelo hi le makumu ka xona.	one cherub on the one end, and one cherub on the other end. Of one piece with the mercy seat he made the cherubim on its two ends.
Tikerubu a ti tlharamulerile timpapa ta tona ehenhla, ti sirhelela xitshamu xa ndzivalelo, ti langutanile, xitshamu xa ndzivalelo xi ri exikarhi.	The cherubim spread out their wings above, overshadowing the mercy seat with their wings, with their faces one to another; toward the mercy seat were the faces of the cherubim.
Kutani a endla tafula ra Xinkwa lexo Hlawuleka hi mapulangi ya murhi wa munga, ri va ni mimpimo leyi: 100 cm ku leha, ni 50 cm ku anama, ni 75 cm ku ya ehenhla	He also made the table of acacia wood. Two cubits was its length, a cubit its breadth, and a cubit and a half its height.
a ri nameka nsuku lowu tengeke, a endla ni nkonye wa nsuku ku rhendzeleka na rona.	And he overlaid it with pure gold, and made a molding of gold around it.
A vekela pulangi ro anama 8 cm ri rhendzeleka ni tafula, a tlhela a endla ni nkonye wa nsuku wu rhendzeleka ni pulangi leri.	And he made a rim around it a handbreadth wide, and made a molding of gold around the rim.
Kutani a ri endlela mune wa swingwavila hi nsuku lowu n'okisiweke, a swi vekela etinhleni leta mune ta tafula, emilengeni ya rona.	He cast for it four rings of gold and fastened the rings to the four corners at its four legs.
Swingwavila swo nghenisa timhandze to rhwala tafula a swi tshamile kusuhi swinene ni pulangi.	Close to the frame were the rings, as holders for the poles to carry the table.
Kutani a vatla timhandze to rhwala tafula, ta murhi wa munga, a ti nameka nsuku.	He made the poles of acacia wood to carry the table, and overlaid them with gold.
Kutani a endla swibya leswi nga ta tshama etafuleni, ti nga tindyelo ta rona, ni minkambana ya rona ya mirhi ya risuna, ni swimbitana swa rona, ni swikhuwana swo chela swilo swa le magandzelweni; hinkwaswo a swi ri swa nsuku lowu tengeke.	And he made the vessels of pure gold that were to be on the table, its plates and dishes for incense, and its bowls and flagons with which to pour drink offerings.
Kutani a endla xitlhoma-timboni hi nsuku lowu tengeke; tshaku ra xona ni nsinya wa xona a swi fula hi nsuku; a endla ni swimbitana leswi sasekisiweke hi swihluke ni matluka ya swiluva, a swi khomanisa ni xitlhoma-timboni.	He also made the lampstand of pure gold. He made the lampstand of hammered work. Its base, its stem, its cups, its calyxes, and its flowers were of one piece with it.
Lomu matlhelo ya xitlhoma-timboni a ku ri ni marhavi ya 6; manharhu a ma humele etlhelweni rin'we, manharhu etlhelweni lerin'wana.	And there were six branches going out of its sides, three branches of the lampstand out of one side of it and three branches of the lampstand out of the other side of it
Rhavi rin'wana ni rin'wana eka marhavi lawa ya 6 lama humeleke ematlhelweni, a ri ri ni swimbitana swinharhu leswi fanaka ni swiluva swa alimondi; xin'wana ni xin'wana xa swimbitana leswi a xi sasekisiwile hi swihluke ni matluka ya swiluva.	three cups made like almond blossoms, each with calyx and flower, on one branch, and three cups made like almond blossoms, each with calyx and flower, on the other branch—so for the six branches going out of the lampstand.
Ensinyeni wa kona, a ku ri ni swimbitana swa mune leswi fanaka ni swiluva swa alimondi; na swona a swi sasekisiwile hi swihluke ni matluka ya swiluva.	And on the lampstand itself were four cups made like almond blossoms, with their calyxes and flowers
Ehansi ka lomu marhavi mambirhi ya xitlhoma-timboni ma hlanganaka kona ni nsinya wa xona, a ku ri ni xilo lexi fanaka ni xihluke, xi khomanile ni nsinya.	and a calyx of one piece with it under each pair of the six branches going out of it.
Swihluke leswi ni marhavi lawa a swi khomanile ni nsinya wa xitlhoma-timboni; xitlhoma-timboni a xi endliwile hi nsuku lowo tenga lowu furiweke.	Their calyxes and their branches were of one piece with it. The whole of it was a single piece of hammered work of pure gold.
Kutani a endla timboni ta 7 ta xitlhoma-timboni, ni swikero swa xona ni timbita ta xona, hi nsuku lowo tenga.	And he made its seven lamps and its tongs and its trays of pure gold.
Xitlhoma-timboni ni swingolongondzwana swa xona hinkwaswo a swi endliwile hi nsuku lowo tenga wo tlulanyana 40 kg hi ku tika.	He made it and all its utensils out of a talent of pure gold.
Kutani a endla alitari yo hisela kona mirhi ya risuna, a yi endla hi mapulangi ya murhi wa munga. Ehenhla ni le hansi ka yona a ku ringanana: 50 cm ku leha ni 50 cm ku anama; ku ya ehenhla a yi ri 100 cm; timhondzo ta yona a ti khomanile na yona.	He made the altar of incense of acacia wood. Its length was a cubit, and its breadth was a cubit. It was square, and two cubits was its height. Its horns were of one piece with it.
A yi nameka nsuku lowo tenga ehenhla ni le matlhelweni hinkwawo, a nameka ni timhondzo ta yona, a endla ni nkonye wa nsuku wu rhendzeleka na yona.	He overlaid it with pure gold, its top and around its sides and its horns. And he made a molding of gold around it
A yi endlela ni swingwavila swimbirhi swa nsuku swo tlhoma timhandze to yi rhwala ha tona, a swi vekela ehansi ka nkonye hala ni hala ematlhelweni ya yona mambirhi.	and made two rings of gold on it under its molding, on two opposite sides of it, as holders for the poles with which to carry it.
A vatla timhandze ta kona hi murhi wa munga, a ti nameka nsuku.	And he made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.
A endla ni mafurha yo tola lama hlawulekeke, ni mirhi yo nun'hwerisa leyo tenga leyi hisiwaka egandzelweni, hi mukhuva lowu muendli wa mirhi leyo nun'hwerisa a pfanganyisaka ha wona.	He made the holy anointing oil also, and the pure fragrant incense, blended as by the perfumer.
Kutani a endla alitari hi mapulangi ya murhi wa munga; ehenhla ni le hansi ka yona a ku ringanana, 2,50 m ku leha ni 2,50 m ku anama; ku ya ehenhla a yi ri 1,50 m.

va rhwala Areka va yi nghenisa eka Ntsonga, va hayeka xisirhelelo, va siva Areka leyi ya Ntwanano, hilaha HOSI Xikwembu xi leriseke Muxe hakona.	And he brought the ark into the tabernacle and set up the veil of the screen, and screened the ark of the testimony, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Kutani va tisa tafula eka Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka va ri veka hi tlhelo ra n'walungu ra Ntsonga, ehandle ka xisirhelelo	He put the table in the tent of meeting, on the north side of the tabernacle, outside the veil
kutani va xaxameta swinkwa etafuleni hi ndlela ya kona, emahlweni ka HOSI Xikwembu, hilaha xi leriseke Muxe hakona.	and arranged the bread on it before the LORD, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Va nghenisa xitlhoma-timboni eka Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka, va xi veka hi tlhelo ra dzonga ra Ntsonga, xi langutana ni tafula	He put the lampstand in the tent of meeting, opposite the table on the south side of the tabernacle
kutani va tlhoma timboni eka xona emahlweni ka HOSI Xikwembu, hilaha xi leriseke Muxe hakona.	and set up the lamps before the LORD, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Va nghenisa alitari ya nsuku eka Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka, va yi veka emahlweni ka xisirhelelo	He put the golden altar in the tent of meeting before the veil
kutani va hisa swinun'hweriso ehenhla ka yona, hilaha HOSI Xikwembu xi leriseke Muxe hakona.	and burned fragrant incense on it, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Va hayeka xisirhelelo xo pfala nyangwa ya Ntsonga	He put in place the screen for the door of the tabernacle.
va veka alitari ya magandzelo lama hisiwaka kusuhi ni nyangwa leyi ya Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka wa HOSI, kutani va hisa magandzelo ya nyama ni ya mapa ehenhla ka alitari, hilaha HOSI Xikwembu xi leriseke Muxe hakona.	And he set the altar of burnt offering at the entrance of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting, and offered on it the burnt offering and the grain offering, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Va veka sambelo exikarhi ka Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka ni alitari, va chela mati yo hlamba eka rona.	He set the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water in it for washing
(Muxe na Aroni ni vana va yena a va hlamba mavoko ni milenge hi mati lawa	with which Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet.
loko va nghena eka Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka, ni loko va ya kusuhi ni alitari, hilaha HOSI Xikwembu xi leriseke Muxe hakona.)	When they went into the tent of meeting, and when they approached the altar, they washed, as the LORD commanded Moses.
Kutani va biyela Ntsonga ni alitari hi xivava, va hayeka ni xisirhelelo xo pfala nyangwa ya xivava. Hi ndlela leyi, Muxe a va a hetile ntirho wa kona.	And he erected the court around the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the screen of the gate of the court. So Moses finished the work.
Kutani papa ri khubumeta Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka, ku kwetsima ka HOSI Xikwembu ku tata Ntsonga.	Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.
Muxe a a nga ha koti ku nghena eka Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka, hikuva papa a ri wu khubumetile, naswona ku kwetsima ka HOSI Xikwembu a ku tatile Ntsonga.	And Moses was not able to enter the tent of meeting because the cloud settled on it, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.
Eriendzweni ra vona hinkwaro, loko papa ri suka ehenhla ka Ntsonga, Vaisraele a va hundzela emahlweni.	Throughout all their journeys, whenever the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the people of Israel would set out.
Kambe loko papa ri nga suki, a va nga yi emahlweni ni riendzo ra vona, ku fikela siku papa ri sukaka.	But if the cloud was not taken up, then they did not set out till the day that it was taken up.
Papa ra HOSI Xikwembu a ri khubumeta Ntsonga ninhlekanhi; nivusiku a ku pfurha ndzilo epapeni, Vaisraele va ri karhi va swi vona, masiku hinkwawo ya riendzo ra vona.	For the cloud of the LORD was on the tabernacle by day, and fire was in it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel throughout all their journeys.
HOSI Xikwembu xi vitana Muxe, xi vula-vula na yena xi ri eka Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka, xi n'wi byela	The LORD called Moses and spoke to him from the tent of meeting, saying
ku ya vulavula ni Vaisraele, a ku ka vona: Loko un'wana wa n'wina a lava ka humesela HOSI Xikwembu magandzelo, ú fanele ku pambula xin'wana xa swifuwo swa yena leswikulu kumbe leswitsongo, a humesa xona.	Speak to the people of Israel and say to them, When any one of you brings an offering to the LORD, you shall bring your offering of livestock from the herd or from the flock.
Loko munhu a humesa magandzelo lama hisiwaka hi xin'wana xa swifuwo swa yena leswikulu, ú fanele ku hlawula nkuzi leyi nga solekiki, a ya yima na yona enyangweni ya Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka, leswaku a ta tsakeriwa hi HOSI Xikwembu.	If his offering is a burnt offering from the herd, he shall offer a male without blemish. He shall bring it to the entrance of the tent of meeting, that he may be accepted before the LORD.
Kutani ú ta tlhandleka voko enhlokweni ya xifuwo xa magandzelo lama hisiwaka, leswaku xi ta n'wi yimela, xi va xo basisa swidyoho swa yena.	He shall lay his hand on the head of the burnt offering, and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.
Kutani ú ta tlhava nkuzi emahlweni ka HOSI Xikwembu. Vaprista, va nga vana va Aroni, va ta teka ngati va yi humesela HOSI Xikwembu hi ku xuva ha yona alitari matlhelo hinkwawo, enyangweni ya Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka.	Then he shall kill the bull before the LORD, and Aaron's sons the priests shall bring the blood and throw the blood against the sides of the altar that is at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
Munhu wa kona ú ta yevula nkuzi ya magandzelo lama hisiwaka, a tsemelela nyama ya yona.	Then he shall flay the burnt offering and cut it into pieces
Kutani vana va muprista Aroni va ta tlhandleka tihunyi alitarini, va tshivela ndzilo	and the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire on the altar and arrange wood on the fire.

Loko swi ri swa le ndzeni ni manqina, swi fanele ku rhanga swi hlantswiwa. Kutani muprista ú ta hisa nyama hinkwayo alitarini. Lawa i magandzelo lama hisiwaka; hi yona mhamba leyi hiseriwaka HOSI Xikwembu, leyi ku nun'hwela ka yona ku nga ta xi tsakisa.	but its entrails and its legs he shall wash with water. And the priest shall burn all of it on the altar, as a burnt offering, a food offering with a pleasing aroma to the LORD.

Xifuwo xa kona a a xi tlhave emahlweni ka HOSI Xikwembu, hi tlhelo ra n'walungu ra alitari. Vaprista, va nga vana va Aroni, va ta teka ngati ya xifuwo, va xuva ha yona alitari matlhelo hinkwawo.	and he shall kill it on the north side of the altar before the LORD, and Aaron's sons the priests shall throw its blood against the sides of the altar.

Loko swi ri swa le ndzeni ni manqina, swona ú fanele ku rhanga a swi hlantswa. Kutani muprista ú ta teka nyama hinkwayo a yi hisa ehenhla ka alitari. Lawa i magandzelo lama hisiwaka; hi yona mhamba leyi hiseriwaka HOSI Xikwembu, leyi ku nun'hwela ka yona ku nga ta xi tsakisa.	but the entrails and the legs he shall wash with water. And the priest shall offer all of it and burn it on the altar; it is a burnt offering, a food offering with a pleasing aroma to the LORD.

And the priest shall bring it to the altar and wring off its head and burn it on the altar. Its blood shall be drained out on the side of the altar.
N'winyi wa tuva ú ta teka chelele ra rona ni tinsiva, a swi cukumeta etaleni leri nga kusuhi ni alitari, hi tlhelo ra le vuxeni.	He shall remove its crop with its contents and cast it beside the altar on the east side, in the place for ashes.

And the priest shall burn it on the altar, on the wood that is on the fire. It is a burnt offering, a food offering with a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
Loko munhu a humesela HOSI Xikwembu magandzelo ya swa le masin'wini, ú fanele ku humesa mapa lamanene, a ma chela mafurha, a ma n'wan'wasela ni murhi wa risuna.	When anyone brings a grain offering as an offering to the LORD, his offering shall be of fine flour. He shall pour oil on it and put frankincense on it
Kutani a ya na swona eka vaprista, va nga vana va Aroni, a fika a nusa mapa lama nga ni mafurha a tata xandla, kutani muprista ú ta swi hisa alitarini ni murhi hinkwawo wa risuna, swi va swo suma ha swona; hi yona mhamba leyi hiseriwaka HOSI Xikwembu, leyi ku nun'hwela ka yona ku nga ta xi tsakisa.	and bring it to Aaron's sons the priests. And he shall take from it a handful of the fine flour and oil, with all of its frankincense, and the priest shall burn this as its memorial portion on the altar, a food offering with a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
Mapa lama saleke eka magandzelo lawa, ma ta va ya Aroni ni vana va yena; ma hlawulekile swinene, hikuva hi lawa ma saleke eka mhamba leyi hiseriwaka HOSI Xikwembu.	But the rest of the grain offering shall be for Aaron and his sons; it is a most holy part of the LORD's food offerings.
Loko mi humesa magandzelo ya swa le masin'wini hi leswi swekiweke kunene, humesani swimbhundzwa leswo-ke-comela leswi endliweke hi mapa lamanene lama cheriweke mafurha, kumbe mi humesa xinkwa xo oma lexo-ke-comela lexi totiweke mafurha.	When you bring a grain offering baked in the oven as an offering, it shall be unleavened loaves of fine flour mixed with oil or unleavened wafers smeared with oil.

You shall not let the salt of the covenant with your God be missing from your grain offering; with all your offerings you shall offer salt.
Loko mi humesela HOSI Xikwembu magandzelo ya swa le masin'wini hi swa ntshovelo wa n'wina wo sungula, mi fanele ku humesa tindzhoho leti katingiweke loko ta ha tsakama, kutani ti khuvutiwa.	If you offer a grain offering of firstfruits to the LORD, you shall offer for the grain offering of your firstfruits fresh ears, roasted with fire, crushed new grain.

Xinkuzana lexi, muprista ú ta xi humesa ku fana ni xinkuzana lexin'wana xa mhamba yo susa swidyoho, a basisa ntshungu ha xona, kutani wu ta rivaleriwa xidyoho xa wona.	Thus shall he do with the bull. As he did with the bull of the sin offering, so shall he do with this. And the priest shall make atonement for them, and they shall be forgiven.
Ú ta rhwala nyama ya xinkuzana lexi a huma na yona emixaxeni, a ya yi hisa ku fana ni nyama ya xinkuzana lexo sungula. Leyi hi yona mhamba yo susa swidyoho swa ntshungu.	And he shall carry the bull outside the camp and burn it up as he burned the first bull; it is the sin offering for the assembly.
Murhangeri a nga tshuka a dyoha ku nga ri ha vomu, a endla xin'wana xa swilo leswi HOSI Xikwembu xa yena xi leriseke leswaku swi nga tshuki swi endliwa, kutani a tikuma a ri ni nandzu.	When a leader sins, doing unintentionally any one of all the things that by the commandments of the LORD his God ought not to be done, and realizes his guilt
Loko a tivisiwa xidyoho lexi a xi endleke, ú fanele ku ta ni xiphongho lexi nga solekiki leswaku a ta humesa magandzelo ha xona	or the sin which he has committed is made known to him, he shall bring as his offering a goat, a male without blemish
a fika a tlhandleka voko ra yena enhlokweni ya xona, a xi tlhavela endhawini leyi va tlhavelaka eka yona swifuwo swa magandzelo lama hisiwaka, emahlweni ka HOSI Xikwembu. Leyi i mhamba yo susa swidyoho.	and shall lay his hand on the head of the goat and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the LORD; it is a sin offering.
Kutani muprista ú ta teka ngatinyana ya xiphongho lexi xa mhamba yo susa swidyoho, a yi tota hi ritiho etimhondzweni ta alitari ya magandzelo lama hisiwaka; ngati leyin'wana hinkwayo, ú ta yi chela ehansi ka alitari leyi ya magandzelo lama hisiwaka.	Then the priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering and pour out the rest of its blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering.
Loko ma ri mafurha ya xiphongho, muprista ú ta ma hisa hinkwawo ehenhla ka alitari, ku fana ni mafurha ya xifuwo xa magandzelo ya xinakulobye. Hi ndlela leyi, muprista ú ta basisa swidyoho swa murhangeri loyi, kutani ú ta rivaleriwa swona.	And all its fat he shall burn on the altar, like the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings. So the priest shall make atonement for him for his sin, and he shall be forgiven.
Munhu ntsena, na yena a nga tshuka a dyoha ku nga ri ha vomu, a endla xin'wana xa swilo leswi HOSI Xikwembu xi leriseke leswaku swi nga tshuki swi endliwa; kutani a tikuma a ri ni nandzu.	If anyone of the common people sins unintentionally in doing any one of the things that by the LORD's commandments ought not to be done, and realizes his guilt
Loko a tivisiwa xidyoho lexi a xi endleke, ú fanele ku ta ni mbuti ya thokazi leyi nga solekiki, a ta yi humesa yi va mhamba yo susa swidyoho swa yena	or the sin which he has committed is made known to him, he shall bring for his offering a goat, a female without blemish, for his sin which he has committed.
a fika a tlhandleka voko ra yena enhlokweni ya mbuti leyi ya mhamba yo susa swidyoho, a yi tlhavela endhawini leyi va tlhavelaka eka yona swifuwo swa magandzelo lama hisiwaka.	And he shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and kill the sin offering in the place of burnt offering.
Kutani muprista ú ta teka ngatinyana ya mbuti leyi, a yi tota hi ritiho etimhondzweni ta alitari ya magandzelo lama hisiwaka; ngati leyin'wana hinkwayo, ú ta yi chela ehansi ka alitari.	And the priest shall take some of its blood with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering and pour out all the rest of its blood at the base of the altar.
Munhu wa kona ú fanele ku tsema mafurha hinkwawo ya mbuti, ku fana ni leswi va tsemisaka swona mafurha ya xifuwo xa magandzelo ya xinakulobye. Kutani muprista ú ta teka mafurha lawa, a ma hisa ehenhla ka alitari, ma va mhamba leyi ku nun'hwela ka yona ku nga ta tsakisa HOSI Xikwembu. Hi ndlela leyi, muprista ú ta va a basisile munhu wa kona, kutani ú ta rivaleriwa swidyoho swa yena.	And all its fat he shall remove, as the fat is removed from the peace offerings, and the priest shall burn it on the altar for a pleasing aroma to the LORD. And the priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be forgiven.
Loko a ta ni nyimpfu ku ta humesa ha yona mhamba yo susa swidyoho, nyimpfu ya kona yi fanele ku va leyi nga solekiki ya xisati.	If he brings a lamb as his offering for a sin offering, he shall bring a female without blemish
Ú ta fika a tlhandleka voko ra yena enhlokweni ya nyimpfu leyi ya mhamba yo susa swidyoho, a yi tlhavela endhawini leyi va tlhavelaka eka yona swifuwo swa magandzelo lama hisiwaka.	and lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and kill it for a sin offering in the place where they kill the burnt offering.
Kutani muprista ú ta teka ngatinyana ya nyimpfu leyi ya mhamba yo susa swidyoho, a yi tota hi ritiho etimhondzweni ta alitari ya magandzelo lama hisiwaka; ngati leyin'wana hinkwayo, ú ta yi chela ehansi ka alitari.	Then the priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering and pour out all the rest of its blood at the base of the altar.
Munhu wa kona ú fanele ku tsema mafurha hinkwawo ya nyimpfu leyi, ku fana ni leswi va tsemisaka swona mafurha ya nyimpfu ya magandzelo ya xinakulobye. Kutani muprista ú ta teka mafurha lawa, a ma hisa ehenhla ka alitari, laha magandzelo lama humeseriwaka HOSI Xikwembu ma hiseriwaka kona. Hi ndlela leyi, muprista ú ta va a basisile munhu wa kona, kutani ú ta rivaleriwa swidyoho leswi a swi endleke.	And all its fat he shall remove as the fat of the lamb is removed from the sacrifice of peace offerings, and the priest shall burn it on the altar, on top of the LORD's food offerings. And the priest shall make atonement for him for the sin which he has committed, and he shall be forgiven.
Loko munhu a vitaniwa ehubyeni ku ya nyika vumbhoni bya mahaka leyi a yi voneke loko yi humelela kumbe leyi a yi tivaka, kambe a yi fihla, ú ni xidyoho, kutani ú fanele ku rhwala nandzu wa yena.	If anyone sins in that he hears a public adjuration to testify, and though he is a witness, whether he has seen or come to know the matter, yet does not speak, he shall bear his iniquity
Kumbe munhu a nga tshuka a khumba xilo lexi nyameke xo fana ni ntsumbu wa xiharhi, kumbe wa xifuwo, kumbe wa xihadyana xin'wana; hambiloko a nga swi tivi, ú nyamisiwile kutani ú ni nandzu.	or if anyone touches an unclean thing, whether a carcass of an unclean wild animal or a carcass of unclean livestock or a carcass of unclean swarming things, and it is hidden from him and he has become unclean, and he realizes his guilt
Kumbe munhu un'wana a nga tshuka a khumbile thyaka rihi na rihi ra vanhu leri nyamisaka; hambiloko a nga swi tivi leswaku ú khumbile swin'wana, siku a swi tivaka ú ta va ni nandzu.	or if he touches human uncleanness, of whatever sort the uncleanness may be with which one becomes unclean, and it is hidden from him, when he comes to know it, and realizes his guilt
Kumbe munhu a nga tshuka a tiboha hi ku hlambanya leswaku a ta endla swin'wana, swi nga va leswo biha kumbe leswinene, kutani a nga rhangi hi ku tiehleketa swinene; ku nga va ku hlambanya kwihi na kwihi loku vanhu va nga tibohaka ha kona va nga tiehleketanga. Hambiloko xidyoho xa yena a nga xi tivi, siku a byeriwaka xona, ú ta va ni nandzu.	or if anyone utters with his lips a rash oath to do evil or to do good, any sort of rash oath that people swear, and it is hidden from him, when he comes to know it, and he realizes his guilt in any of these
Loko munhu a tivangerile wun'wana wa milandzu leyi, ú ta fanela ku pfumela leswaku ú dyohile	when he realizes his guilt in any of these and confesses the sin he has committed
kutani a humesela HOSI Xikwembu mhamba leyi nga ta susa xidyoho lexi; a nga humesa xifuwo lexitsongo xa xisati, xo fana ni nyimpfu kumbe mbuti. Kutani muprista ú ta n'wi basisa exidyohweni lexi a xi endleke.	he shall bring to the LORD as his compensation for the sin that he has committed, a female from the flock, a lamb or a goat, for a sin offering. And the priest shall make atonement for him for his sin.
Munhu wa kona a nga tshuka a pfumala xifuwo lexitsongo xo susa ha xona xidyoho lexi a xi endleke. Loko swi ri tano, ú ta humesela HOSI Xikwembu matuva mambirhi kumbe mavondlo mambirhi ya matuva, rin'we ri va ra mhamba yo susa swidyoho, lerin'wana ri va ra magandzelo lama hisiwaka.	But if he cannot afford a lamb, then he shall bring to the LORD as his compensation for the sin that he has committed two turtledoves or two pigeons, one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering.
Ú ta ta ni matuva lawa eka muprista, kutani muprista ú ta rhanga a humesa lera mhamba yo susa swidyoho; ú ta ri soholota nhamu, kambe a nga tsemi nhloko ya rona.	He shall bring them to the priest, who shall offer first the one for the sin offering. He shall wring its head from its neck but shall not sever it completely
Kutani ú ta teka ngatinyana ya tuva leri ra mhamba yo susa swidyoho, a xuva ha yona lomu matlhelo ka alitari; ngati leyin'wana hinkwayo, ú ta yi kamela ehansi ka alitari; leyi hi yona mhamba yo susa swidyoho.	and he shall sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering on the side of the altar, while the rest of the blood shall be drained out at the base of the altar; it is a sin offering.
Tuva lera vumbirhi, muprista ú ta humesa ha rona magandzelo lama hisiwaka, hi ku ya hi nawu wa kona. Hi ndlela leyi, muprista ú ta va a basisile munhu loyi, kutani ú ta rivaleriwa swidyoho leswi a swi endleke.	Then he shall offer the second for a burnt offering according to the rule. And the priest shall make atonement for him for the sin that he has committed, and he shall be forgiven.
Loko munhu loyi a pfumala matuva mambirhi kumbe mavondlo mambirhi ya matuva yo susa ha wona xidyoho lexi a xi endleke, a nga humesa xintewana xin'we xa mapa lamanene yi va mhamba yo susa swidyoho leswi a swi endleke; mapa lawa, ma nga tshuki ma cheriwa mafurha kumbe murhi wa risuna, hikuva i mhamba yo susa swidyoho.	But if he cannot afford two turtledoves or two pigeons, then he shall bring as his offering for the sin that he has committed a tenth of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering. He shall put no oil on it and shall put no frankincense on it, for it is a sin offering.
Munhu wa kona ú fanele ku yisa mapa lawa eka muprista, kutani muprista ú ta nusa yo tata xandla, ma va yo suma ha wona, a ma hisa alitarini, swin'we ni magandzelo lama hiseriwaka HOSI Xikwembu; leyi i mhamba yo susa swidyoho.	And he shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take a handful of it as its memorial portion and burn this on the altar, on the LORD's food offerings; it is a sin offering.
Hi ndlela leyi, muprista ú ta basisa munhu loyi eka xidyoho xihi na xihi lexi a xi endleke, kutani ú ta rivaleriwa. Mapa lawa ya saleke, ma ta va ya muprista, ku fana ni loko ku humesiwa magandzelo ya swa le masin'wini.	Thus the priest shall make atonement for him for the sin which he has committed in any one of these things, and he shall be forgiven. And the remainder shall be for the priest, as in the grain offering.
HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe	The LORD spoke to Moses, saying
Munhu a nga tshuka a dyoha, kambe ku nga ri ha vomu, a rivala ku humesela mina Hosi mihlengo leyo hlawuleka. Munhu wo tano, ú fanele ku humesa rin'wana ra makhuna ya ntlhambi wa yena leri nga solekiki, ra nxavo lowu vekiwaka hi ku ya hi ntiko wa lexi ku pimiwaka ha xona, lexi hlayisiwaka exivandleni lexo hlawuleka; ú ta ta ni khuna leri, ri va gandzelo ro riha nandzu wa yena.	If anyone commits a breach of faith and sins unintentionally in any of the holy things of the LORD, he shall bring to the LORD as his compensation, a ram without blemish out of the flock, valued in silver shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, for a guilt offering.
Tlhandlakambirhi, ú fanele ku humesa mihlengo leyi a a rivele ku yi humesa, a tlhandlekela hi xiphemu xa ⅕ xa nxavo wa kona, a ya nyika muprista. Muprista ú ta n'wi basisa hi khuna ra gandzelo ro riha milandzu, kutani ú ta rivaleriwa nandzu wa yena.	He shall also make restitution for what he has done amiss in the holy thing and shall add a fifth to it and give it to the priest. And the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering, and he shall be forgiven.
Munhu loyi a dyoheke, kambe ku nga ri ha vomu, a endla xin'wana xa swilo leswi ndzi leriseke leswaku swi nga tshuki swi endliwa, ú ni nandzu; kutani ú fanele ku wu rhwala	If anyone sins, doing any of the things that by the LORD's commandments ought not to be done, though he did not know it, then realizes his guilt, he shall bear his iniquity.
a pambula rin'wana ra makhuna ya ntlhambi wa yena, leri nga solekiki, ra nxavo wo ringana ni wa xifuwo xa magandzelo yo riha milandzu, kutani a ri yisa eka muprista. Muprista ú ta basisa munhu loyi, kutani ú ta rivaleriwa xihoxo lexi a xi endleke ku nga ri ha vomu.	He shall bring to the priest a ram without blemish out of the flock, or its equivalent, for a guilt offering, and the priest shall make atonement for him for the mistake that he made unintentionally, and he shall be forgiven.
Munhu loyi ú ni nandzu emahlweni ka mina HOSI, kutani lawa hi wona magandzelo yo riha nandzu wa kona.	It is a guilt offering; he has indeed incurred guilt before the LORD.
HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe	The LORD spoke to Moses, saying
Munhu a nga tshuka a dyoha, a kumeka a nga tshembekanga eka mina HOSI, hi ku va a kanganyisile munhukulobye; a nga va a ala ku tlherisa leswi va lombaneke swona, kumbe leswi va khomisaneke swona, kumbe a n'wi dyelela, kumbe ku n'wi xanisa.	If anyone sins and commits a breach of faith against the LORD by deceiving his neighbor in a matter of deposit or security, or through robbery, or if he has oppressed his neighbor
Naswona a nga va a thumbhile swin'wana leswi lahlekeke, kambe a hemba a ku, a nga swi tivi, a tlhela a tiyisa mavunwa ya yena hi ku hlambanya; kumbe a nga va a endlile xin'wana xa leswi dyohisaka vanhu.	or has found something lost and lied about it, swearing falsely—in any of all the things that people do and sin thereby
Loko munhu a tshuka a tivangele nandzu hi ku dyoha, ú fanele ku tlherisa leswi a swi kumeke hi ku dyelela, kumbe hi ku xanisa van'wana, kumbe leswi a a khomisiwile swona, kumbe leswi a swi lahlekile kutani yena a swi thumbha	if he has sinned and has realized his guilt and will restore what he took by robbery or what he got by oppression or the deposit that was committed to him or the lost thing that he found
kumbe xilo xihi na xihi lexi a hlambanyeke a hemba a ku a nga xi tivi. Siku leri a humesaka magandzelo yo riha, ú fanele ku tlherisela swilo leswi hinkwaswo eka vinyi va swona, a tlhandlekela hi xiphemu xa ⅕ xa nxavo wa swona.	or anything about which he has sworn falsely, he shall restore it in full and shall add a fifth to it, and give it to him to whom it belongs on the day he realizes his guilt.
Ú fanele ku pambula khuna rin'we leri nga solekiki entlhambini wa yena, a ri yisa eka muprista leswaku ri va mhamba yo riha nandzu wa yena eka mina HOSI; nxavo wa khuna ra kona wu fanele ku ringana ni wa xifuwo xa magandzelo yo riha milandzu.	And he shall bring to the priest as his compensation to the LORD a ram without blemish out of the flock, or its equivalent, for a guilt offering.
Muprista ú ta n'wi basisa emahlweni ka mina, kutani ú ta rivaleriwa hinkwaswo leswi a nga vaka a tivangele nandzu hi ku endla swona.	And the priest shall make atonement for him before the LORD, and he shall be forgiven for any of the things that one may do and thereby become guilty.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi byela Muxe	The LORD spoke to Moses, saying
ku ya vulavula na Aroni ni vana va yena, a va lerisa a ku: Nawu hi tlhelo ra magandzelo lama hisiwaka hi lowu: Nyama ya xifuwo xa kona yi fanele ku tshama endzilweni wa le alitarini vusiku hinkwabyo wu ri karhi wu hlanganyetiwa, ri ko ri xa.	Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the burnt offering. The burnt offering shall be on the hearth on the altar all night until the morning, and the fire of the altar shall be kept burning on it.
Muprista ú fanele ku ambala hembe ya yena ya ntsembyani ni xiburukwana xa ntsembyani xo tisiva ha xona, a teka nkuma lowu saleke alitarini loko ku hisiwa magandzelo, a wu chela kusuhi ni alitari.	And the priest shall put on his linen garment and put his linen undergarment on his body, and he shall take up the ashes to which the fire has reduced the burnt offering on the altar and put them beside the altar.
Loko a hetile, ú fanele ku hluvula leswi a swi ambaleke, a ambala swin'wana, kutani a olela nkuma lowu, a wu yisa ehandle ka mixaxa exivandleni lexi tengeke.	Then he shall take off his garments and put on other garments and carry the ashes outside the camp to a clean place.
Ndzilo wa le alitarini wu fanele ku hlanganyetiwa leswaku wu nga timeki. Mpundzu wun'wana ni wun'wana, muprista ú ta tlhandleka tihunyi tin'wana, a veketela nyama ya magandzelo lama hisiwaka ehenhla ka tona, a hisa ni mafurha ya magandzelo ya xinakulobye.	The fire on the altar shall be kept burning on it; it shall not go out. The priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and he shall arrange the burnt offering on it and shall burn on it the fat of the peace offerings.
Ndzilo wu fanele ku tshama wu ri karhi wu pfurha alitarini, wu nga tshuki wu timeka.	Fire shall be kept burning on the altar continually; it shall not go out.
Hi tlhelo ra magandzelo ya swa le masin'wini, nawu wa kona hi lowu: Vana va Aroni hi vona va nga ta humesela HOSI Xikwembu magandzelo ya swa le masin'wini, emahlweni ka alitari.	And this is the law of the grain offering. The sons of Aaron shall offer it before the LORD in front of the altar.
Un'wana wa vona ú ta teka mapa lamanene ya magandzelo ya swa le masin'wini, a ma nusa ni mafurha ya kona a tata xandla, kutani a ma hisa alitarini ni murhi hinkwawo wa risuna, swi va swo suma ha swona; ku nun'hwela ka swona ku ta tsakisa HOSI Xikwembu.	And one shall take from it a handful of the fine flour of the grain offering and its oil and all the frankincense that is on the grain offering and burn this as its memorial portion on the altar, a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
Mapa lama salaka ma ta dyiwa hi Aroni ni vana va yena; ma fanele ku endla xinkwa lexo-ke-comela, lexi nga ta dyeriwa exivandleni lexi hlawulekeke, ku nga xivaveni xa Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka.	And the rest of it Aaron and his sons shall eat. It shall be eaten unleavened in a holy place. In the court of the tent of meeting they shall eat it.
Loko va sweka xinkwa lexi, va nga tshuki va chela comela. Xinkwa lexi i xiphemu lexi va fanelaka ku nyikiwa xona eka leswi hiseriwaka HOSI Xikwembu; xi hlawulekile swinene, xi fana ni mhamba yo susa swidyoho kumbe magandzelo yo riha milandzu.	It shall not be baked with leaven. I have given it as their portion of my food offerings. It is a thing most holy, like the sin offering and the guilt offering.
Xinkwa lexi xi ta dyiwa hi vana va xinuna va ka Aroni, hi ku landza nawu lowu mi vekeriweke wona hi tlhelo ra magandzelo lama hiseriwaka HOSI Xikwembu. Nawu lowu wu boha n'wina ni vatukulu va n'wina hilaha ku nga heriki. Un'wana ni un'wana loyi a nga ta khumba xinkwa lexi, ú ta hundzuka loyi a hlawulekeke.	Every male among the children of Aaron may eat of it, as decreed forever throughout your generations, from the LORD's food offerings. Whatever touches them shall become holy.
HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe	The LORD spoke to Moses, saying
Siku leri Aroni ni vana va yena va cheriwaka mafurha enhlokweni, va fanele ku humesela HOSI Xikwembu magandzelo hi swilo leswi: xintewana xin'we xa mapa lamanene, wu nga mpimo lowu ringanaka ni mapa ya magandzelo ya siku rin'wana ni rin'wana; a va humese hafu nimpundzu, hafu leyin'wana nimadyambu.	This is the offering that Aaron and his sons shall offer to the LORD on the day when he is anointed: a tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a regular grain offering, half of it in the morning and half in the evening.
Mapa lawa ma fanele ku pfuviwa ni mafurha, ma oxiwa ma endla xinkwa lexi nga ta phemeleriwa ku fana ni xa magandzelo ya swa le masin'wini, kutani xi hisiwa; ku nun'hwela ka xona ku ta tsakisa HOSI Xikwembu.	It shall be made with oil on a griddle. You shall bring it well mixed, in baked pieces like a grain offering, and offer it for a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
Loyi a fanelaka ku hisa xinkwa lexi exikarhi ka vana va Aroni, hi loyi a nga ta cheriwa mafurha enhlokweni leswaku a teka ntirho wa Aroni. Xinkwa lexi xi fanele ku humesiwa hinkwaxo, xi hiseriwa HOSI Xikwembu hi ku landza nawu lowu nga ta ka wu nga hundzuki.	The priest from among Aaron's sons, who is anointed to succeed him, shall offer it to the LORD as decreed forever. The whole of it shall be burned.
Leswi vaprista va humesaka ha swona magandzelo ya vona ya swa le masin'wini, swi fanele ku hisiwa hinkwaswo, ku nga dyiwi nchumu eka swona.	Every grain offering of a priest shall be wholly burned. It shall not be eaten.
HOSI Xikwembu xi byela Muxe	The LORD spoke to Moses, saying
ku ya vulavula na Aroni ni vana va yena, a ku ka vona: Nawu hi tlhelo ra mhamba yo susa swidyoho hi lowu: Xifuwo xa mhamba yo susa swidyoho xi fanele ku tlhaveriwa endhawini leyi ku tlhaveriwaka eka yona xifuwo xa magandzelo lama hisiwaka. Mhamba leyi yi hlawulekile swinene.	Speak to Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin offering. In the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed before the LORD; it is most holy.
Muprista loyi a nga ta fambisa ntirho wa mhamba yo susa swidyoho, hi yena ntsena loyi a nga ta dya nyama ya kona, a yi dyela exivandleni lexi hlawulekeke, ku nga xivaveni xa Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka.	The priest who offers it for sin shall eat it. In a holy place it shall be eaten, in the court of the tent of meeting.
Xilo xin'wana ni xin'wana lexi nga ta khumbana ni nyama ya xifuwo xa kona, xi ta hundzuka lexi hlawulekeke. Loko ngati ya kona yo tshuka yi tlhambukela exiambalweni, xiambalo xexo xi fanele ku ya hlantsweriwa exivandleni lexi hlawulekeke.	Whatever touches its flesh shall be holy, and when any of its blood is splashed on a garment, you shall wash that on which it was splashed in a holy place.
Mbita leyi yi nga ta va yi swekile nyama, yi fanele ku fayeteriwa; kasi loko nyama ya kona yi swekiwile hi poto, poto ra kona ri fanele ku hariwa swinene, ri hlantswiwa ri basa.	And the earthenware vessel in which it is boiled shall be broken. But if it is boiled in a bronze vessel, that shall be scoured and rinsed in water.
Nyama leyi yi ta dyiwa hi wanuna un'wana ni un'wana loyi a nga muprista; yi hlawulekile swinene.	Every male among the priests may eat of it; it is most holy.
Nyama ya xifuwo xa mhamba yo susa swidyoho lexi ngati ya xona yi yisiweke eka Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka ku ya basisa swidyoho exivandleni lexi hlawulekeke, yi nga tshuki yi dyiwa, yi fanele ku hisiwa hinkwayo.	But no sin offering shall be eaten from which any blood is brought into the tent of meeting to make atonement in the Holy Place; it shall be burned up with fire.
Nawu hi tlhelo ra magandzelo yo riha milandzu, ma nga lawa ya hlawulekeke ngopfu, hi lowu	This is the law of the guilt offering. It is most holy.
Xifuwo xa kona xi fanele ku tlhaveriwa endhawini leyi ku tlhaveriwaka eka yona xifuwo xa magandzelo lama hisiwaka, kutani ngati ya xona yi tirhisiwa ku xuva alitari matlhelo hinkwawo.	In the place where they kill the burnt offering they shall kill the guilt offering, and its blood shall be thrown against the sides of the altar.
Mafurha ya xona hinkwawo ma fanele ku tsemiwa, wu nga ncila, ni mafurha lama khomaneke ni swa le ndzeni	And all its fat shall be offered, the fat tail, the fat that covers the entrails
ni tinso hi timbirhi ka tona, ni mafurha ya kona; tinso leti ti fanele ku tsemiwa swin'we ni tlhelo lero saseka ra xivindzi.	the two kidneys with the fat that is on them at the loins, and the long lobe of the liver that he shall remove with the kidneys.
Muprista ú ta hisa swilo leswi ehenhla ka alitari, a swi hisela HOSI Xikwembu; lawa i magandzelo yo riha milandzu.	The priest shall burn them on the altar as a food offering to the LORD; it is a guilt offering.
Wanuna un'wana ni un'wana loyi a nga muprista a nga dya nyama ya xifuwo xa kona, yi dyeriwa exivandleni lexi hlawulekeke, hikuva yi hlawulekile ngopfu.	Every male among the priests may eat of it. It shall be eaten in a holy place. It is most holy.
Nawu hi tlhelo ra magandzelo yo riha milandzu, wu fana ni wa mhamba yo susa swidyoho: Nyama ya xifuwo xa kona i ya muprista loyi a basisaka swidyoho ha xona.	The guilt offering is just like the sin offering; there is one law for them. The priest who makes atonement with it shall have it.
Loko munhu a humesa magandzelo lama hisiwaka, dzovo ra xifuwo xa kona ri ta va ra muprista loyi a fambiseke ntirho wa magandzelo.	And the priest who offers any man's burnt offering shall have for himself the skin of the burnt offering that he has offered.
Muprista loyi a fambisaka ntirho wa magandzelo ya swa le masin'wini, ú ta kuma leswi swekiweke kunene, kumbe leswi oxiweke kumbe leswi katingiweke.	And every grain offering baked in the oven and all that is prepared on a pan or a griddle shall belong to the priest who offers it.
Kasi mapa ya magandzelo ya swa le masin'wini, lama cheriweke mafurha kumbe lama nga cheriwangiki, ma ta va ya vaprista hinkwavo, va phakeriwa mimpimo leyi ringanaka.	And every grain offering, mixed with oil or dry, shall be shared equally among all the sons of Aaron.
Nawu hi tlhelo ra magandzelo ya xinakulobye, lawa munhu a nga ma humeselaka HOSI Xikwembu, hi lowu	And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings that one may offer to the LORD.
Loko magandzelo lawa munhu wa kona a ma humesaka ma ri ya ku nkhensa Xikwembu, ú fanele ku tlhandlekela hi swimbhundzwa leswo-ke-comela leswi cheriweke mafurha, ni xinkwa lexo oma lexo-ke-comela lexi totiweke mafurha, ni swimbhundzwa swa mapa lamanene lama pfuviweke ni mafurha.	If he offers it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the thanksgiving sacrifice unleavened loaves mixed with oil, unleavened wafers smeared with oil, and loaves of fine flour well mixed with oil.
Tlhandlakambirhi, ú fanele ku ma humesa ni swimbhundzwa swin'wana leswi cheriweke comela.	With the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving he shall bring his offering with loaves of leavened bread.
Eka swinkwa leswi ni swimbhundzwa leswi, a a pambule xin'we-xin'we, yi va nyiko leyi humeseriwaka HOSI Xikwembu; leswi swi ta va swa muprista loyi a nga ta fambisa ntirho wo xuva hi ngati ya xifuwo xa magandzelo lawa ya xinakulobye.	And from it he shall offer one loaf from each offering, as a gift to the LORD. It shall belong to the priest who throws the blood of the peace offerings.
Nyama ya magandzelo ya xinakulobye lawa munhu a nkhensaka Xikwembu ha wona, yi fanele ku dyiwa yi hela hi siku leri a ma humesaka ha rona; a nga tshuki a siya yin'wana ku kondza ku fika mpundzu wa siku leri tlhandlamaka.	And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten on the day of his offering. He shall not leave any of it until the morning.
Kambe loko magandzelo ya kona ma ri lawa a tiboheke hi ku hlambanya leswaku ú ta ma humesa, kumbe lawa a ngo ma humesa hi ku titwa, nyama ya xifuwo xa kona yi nga ha dyiwa siku leri a ma humesaka ha rona, kutani leyi salaka yi nga hetisiwa siku leri tlhandlamaka.	But if the sacrifice of his offering is a vow offering or a freewill offering, it shall be eaten on the day that he offers his sacrifice, and on the next day what remains of it shall be eaten.
Kambe loko hi siku ra vunharhu ko tshuka ku va ni nyama leyi ya ha saleke, yona yi fanele ku hisiwa.	But what remains of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burned up with fire.
Loko nyama leyi nga ta va ya ha sele hi siku ra vunharhu, yo dyiwa, loyi a humesaka magandzelo ya kona ya xinakulobye a nge nkhensiwi, swi ta tekiwa wonge a nga humesanga nchumu; sweswo swa yila, loyi a dyaka nyama ya kona ú ta va a tivangele nandzu.	If any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offering is eaten on the third day, he who offers it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be credited to him. It is tainted, and he who eats of it shall bear his iniquity.
Nyama leyi khumbaneke ni swilo leswi nga tengangiki, yi nga tshuki yi dyiwa, a yi hisiwe!
Vanhu hinkwavo lava tengeke, va nga dya nyama	Flesh that touches any unclean thing shall not be eaten. It shall be burned up with fire. All who are clean may eat flesh
ya magandzelo ya xinakulobye lama humeseriwaka HOSI Xikwembu, kambe munhu loyi a dyaka nyama leyi enkarhini lowu a nga tengangiki, ú fanele ku hlongoriwa a suka exikarhi ka va ka vona.	but the person who eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of the LORD's peace offerings while an uncleanness is on him, that person shall be cut off from his people.
Munhu a nga tshuka a khumbana ni xilo lexi nga tengangiki; ku nga va thyaka ra vanhu, kumbe xiharhi lexi nga tengangiki, kumbe xilo xihi na xihi lexi yilaka hi ku ka xi nga tenganga; loko munhu wo tano o dya nyama ya xifuwo xa magandzelo ya xinakulobye lama humeseriwaka HOSI Xikwembu, ú fanele ku hlongoriwa a suka exikarhi ka va ka vona.	And if anyone touches an unclean thing, whether human uncleanness or an unclean beast or any unclean detestable creature, and then eats some flesh from the sacrifice of the LORD's peace offerings, that person shall be cut off from his people.
HOSI Xikwembu xi byela Muxe	The LORD spoke to Moses, saying
ku ya vulavula na Vaisraele, a ku ka vona: Mi nga tshuki mi dya mafurha, ma nga va ya homu kumbe ya nyimpfu kumbe ya mbuti.	Speak to the people of Israel, saying, You shall eat no fat, of ox or sheep or goat.
Hambi ma ri mafurha ya xifuwo lexi nga lo tifela hi xoxe, kumbe lexi dlayiweke hi swivandzana, mi nga tshuki mi dya, kambe mi nga endla swin'wana ha wona.	The fat of an animal that dies of itself and the fat of one that is torn by beasts may be put to any other use, but on no account shall you eat it.
Munhu un'wana ni un'wana loyi a dyaka mafurha ya xifuwo lexi vanhu va nga xi tlhavaka va humesela HOSI Xikwembu magandzelo ha xona, ú fanele ku hlongoriwa a suka exikarhi ka va ka vona.	For every person who eats of the fat of an animal of which a food offering may be made to the LORD shall be cut off from his people.
Hinkwako lomu mi akeke kona, mi nga tshuki mi dya ngati ya tinyanyana kumbe ya swifuwo.	Moreover, you shall eat no blood whatever, whether of fowl or of animal, in any of your dwelling places.
Un'wana ni un'wana loyi a dyaka ngati, yi nga va yihi kumbe yihi, ú fanele ku hlongoriwa a suka exikarhi ka va ka vona.	Whoever eats any blood, that person shall be cut off from his people.
HOSI Xikwembu xi byela Muxe	The LORD spoke to Moses, saying
ku ya vulavula na Vaisraele, a ku ka vona: Loko munhu a lava ku humesela HOSI Xikwembu magandzelo ya xinakulobye, ú fanele ku pambula swin'wana swa magandzelo lawa a ma humesaka	Speak to the people of Israel, saying, Whoever offers the sacrifice of his peace offerings to the LORD shall bring his offering to the LORD from the sacrifice of his peace offerings.
a swi yisa eka HOSI Xikwembu hi voko ra yena, swi va swa magandzelo lama hisiwaka; ú ta yisa mafurha, a yisa ni xifuva lexi xi nga ta widzeriwa HOSI Xikwembu, xi va nyiko ya xona leyo hlawuleka.	His own hands shall bring the LORD's food offerings. He shall bring the fat with the breast, that the breast may be waved as a wave offering before the LORD.
Muprista ú ta hisa mafurha ya kona ehenhla ka alitari, kasi xifuva xi ta va xa Aroni ni vana va yena.	The priest shall burn the fat on the altar, but the breast shall be for Aaron and his sons.
Nenge wa xinene wa xifuwo xa magandzelo ya xinakulobye wu ta nyikiwa muprista	And the right thigh you shall give to the priest as a contribution from the sacrifice of your peace offerings.
loyi a nga ta fambisa ntirho wo xuva hi ngati ni wa ku hisa mafurha. Exikarhi ka vana va Aroni, hi yena loyi a nga ta kuma nenge lowu, wu va wa yena.	Whoever among the sons of Aaron offers the blood of the peace offerings and the fat shall have the right thigh for a portion.
Xifuva xa nyiko leyo hlawuleka ni nenge lowu humesiwaka wu va nyiko, swi fanele ku va swa muprista Aroni ni vana va yena; swi ta pamburiwa eka magandzelo ya xinakulobye ya Vaisraele, hi ku landza nawu lowu wu nga ta va boha hilaha ku nga heriki.	For the breast that is waved and the thigh that is contributed I have taken from the people of Israel, out of the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons, as a perpetual due from the people of Israel.
Lexi i xiphemu xa Aroni ni vana va yena lexi pamburiwaka eka magandzelo lama hiseriwaka HOSI Xikwembu; va hlawuleriwile xona siku va vekiweke entirhweni wa vuprista leswaku va ta tirhela HOSI Xikwembu.	This is the portion of Aaron and of his sons from the LORD's food offerings, from the day they were presented to serve as priests of the LORD.
Esikwini leri ra ku cheriwa ka vona mafurha enhlokweni, HOSI Xikwembu xi lerisile leswaku Vaisraele va hamba va va nyika xiphemu lexi; vaprista va fanele ku nyikiwa xona hilaha ku nga heriki.	The LORD commanded this to be given them by the people of Israel, from the day that he anointed them. It is a perpetual due throughout their generations.
Leyi hi yona milawu ya magandzelo lama hisiwaka, ni ya magandzelo ya swa le masin'wini, ni ya timhamba to susa swidyoho, ni ya magandzelo yo riha milandzu, ni ya magandzelo ya siku ra ku vekiwa ka vaprista, ni ya magandzelo ya xinakulobye.	This is the law of the burnt offering, of the grain offering, of the sin offering, of the guilt offering, of the ordination offering, and of the peace offering
Muxe ú nyikiwile yona hi HOSI Xikwembu entshaveni ya Sinayi, siku xi leriseke Vaisraele leswaku va xi humesela magandzelo, loko va ri emananga ya Sinayi.	which the LORD commanded Moses on Mount Sinai, on the day that he commanded the people of Israel to bring their offerings to the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe	The LORD spoke to Moses, saying
Tana na Aroni ni vana va yena enyangweni ya Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka, u teka ni swiambalo swa vuprista, ni mafurha yo tola, ni xinkuzana xa mhamba yo susa swidyoho, ni makhuna mambirhi, ni xirhundzu xa swinkwa leswo-ke-comela	Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments and the anointing oil and the bull of the sin offering and the two rams and the basket of unleavened bread.
u vitana ni ntshungu hinkwawo wa Vaisraele, wu ta hlengeletana enyangweni.	And assemble all the congregation at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
Kavaloko Muxe a endla hilaha HOSI Xikwembu xi n'wi leriseke hakona, kutani ntshungu wa Vaisraele wu hlengeletana enyangweni ya Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka.	And Moses did as the LORD commanded him, and the congregation was assembled at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
Kutani Muxe a ku ka vona: Leswi hi swona leswi HOSI Xikwembu xi leriseke leswaku swi endliwa.	And Moses said to the congregation, This is the thing that the LORD has commanded to be done.
Kutani Muxe a vitana Aroni ni vana va yena, a va hlambisa hi mati	And Moses brought Aaron and his sons and washed them with water.
kutani a ambexa Aroni ehembe, a n'wi khama hi vamba, a n'wi ambexa ni nguvu leyo leha, a tlhandleka efodi ehenhla, a tlhela a n'wi khama hi vamba ra yona.	And he put the coat on him and tied the sash around his waist and clothed him with the robe and put the ephod on him and tied the skillfully woven band of the ephod around him, binding it to him with the band.
Kutani a ambexa Aroni xincekana xa le xifuveni, a nghenisa Urimi na Thumimi eka xona	And he placed the breastpiece on him, and in the breastpiece he put the Urim and the Thummim.
a n'wi ambexa xihuku enhlokweni, emahlweni ka xona a bohelela harhi leyo hlawuleka ya nsuku ya xiphepherhele, hilaha HOSI Xikwembu xi n'wi leriseke hakona.	And he set the turban on his head, and on the turban, in front, he set the golden plate, the holy crown, as the LORD commanded Moses.
Kutani Muxe a teka mafurha yo tola, a tota Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka ni swingolongondzwana swa wona hinkwaswo, a swi hlawulekisa	Then Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and all that was in it, and consecrated them.
kutani a teka mafurhanyana a xuva alitari ha wona ka 7, a tlhela a yi tota, a tota ni swibya swa yona hinkwaswo, ni sambelo ni xikhatelo xa rona, a swi hlawulekisa.	And he sprinkled some of it on the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all its utensils and the basin and its stand, to consecrate them.
Kutani a teka mafurha man'wana, a chela enhlokweni ya Aroni, a n'wi tota a n'wi hlawulekisa.	And he poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron's head and anointed him to consecrate him.
Kutani Muxe a vitana vana va Aroni, a va ambexa tihembe, a va khama hi mavamba, a va boha swihuku leswitsongo etinhlokweni, hilaha HOSI Xikwembu xi n'wi leriseke hakona.	And Moses brought Aaron's sons and clothed them with coats and tied sashes around their waists and bound caps on them, as the LORD commanded Moses.
Muxe a ta ni xinkuzana xa mhamba yo susa swidyoho, Aroni ni vana va yena va tlhandleka mavoko ya vona enhlokweni ya xinkuzana lexi.	Then he brought the bull of the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull of the sin offering.
Kutani Muxe a tlhava xinkuzana, a teka ngatinyana ya xona, a peta ritiho a tota etimhondzweni leti nga tinhleni ta alitari, yi va mhamba yo susa swidyoho; leyin'wana ngati a yi chela ehansi ka alitari. Hi ndlela leyi, Muxe a hlawulekisa alitari ni ku yi basisa.	And he killed it, and Moses took the blood, and with his finger put it on the horns of the altar around it and purified the altar and poured out the blood at the base of the altar and consecrated it to make atonement for it.
Muxe a tsema mafurha hinkwawo lama khomaneke ni swa le ndzeni, a tsema ni tlhelo lero saseka ra xivindzi, ni tinso hi timbirhi ka tona, ni mafurha ya kona, kutani a swi hisa ehenhla ka alitari.	And he took all the fat that was on the entrails and the long lobe of the liver and the two kidneys with their fat, and Moses burned them on the altar.
Kambe nyama hinkwayo ya xinkuzana, ni dzovo ra xona, ni nswanyi, Muxe a swi teka a ya swi hisa ehandle ka mixaxa, hilaha HOSI Xikwembu xi n'wi leriseke hakona.	But the bull and its skin and its flesh and its dung he burned up with fire outside the camp, as the LORD commanded Moses.
Kutani Muxe a ta ni khuna ra magandzelo lama hisiwaka. Aroni ni vana va yena va tlhandleka mavoko ya vona enhlokweni ya rona	Then he presented the ram of the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.
kutani Muxe a tlhava khuna leri, a teka ngati ya rona, a xuva ha yona alitari matlhelo hinkwawo.	And he killed it, and Moses threw the blood against the sides of the altar.
Loko khuna ri tsemeleriwile, Muxe a hisa nyama ya kona, ni nhloko, ni mafurha.	He cut the ram into pieces, and Moses burned the head and the pieces and the fat.
Swa le ndzeni ni manqina, Muxe ú rhange hi ku swi hlantswa a nga si swi hisa ni nyama leyin'wana hinkwayo ehenhla ka alitari. Lawa hi wona magandzelo lama hiseriwaka HOSI Xikwembu, lawa ku nun'hwela ka wona ku xi tsakisaka, hilaha xi leriseke Muxe hakona.	He washed the entrails and the legs with water, and Moses burned the whole ram on the altar. It was a burnt offering with a pleasing aroma, a food offering for the LORD, as the LORD commanded Moses.
Kutani Muxe a tisa khuna lerin'wana, ri nga ra ku vekiwa ka vaprista; Aroni ni vana va yena va tlhandleka mavoko ya vona enhlokweni ya rona	Then he presented the other ram, the ram of ordination, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.
kutani Muxe a ri tlhava, a teka ngatinyana ya rona, a tota Aroni emakumu ka ndleve ya yena ya xinene, ni le khudzwini ra voko ra xinene, ni le khudzwini ra nenge wa xinene.	And he killed it, and Moses took some of its blood and put it on the lobe of Aaron's right ear and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot.
Vana va Aroni na vona va vitaniwa, kutani Muxe a teka ngatinyana, a va tota emakumu ka ndleve ya xinene, ni le khudzwini ra voko ra xinene, ni le khudzwini ra nenge wa xinene; ngati leyin'wana, Muxe a xuva ha yona alitari matlhelo hinkwawo.	Then he presented Aaron's sons, and Moses put some of the blood on the lobes of their right ears and on the thumbs of their right hands and on the big toes of their right feet. And Moses threw the blood against the sides of the altar.
Kutani Muxe a tsema mafurha, ni ncila, ni mafurha hinkwawo lama khomaneke ni swa le ndzeni, a tsema ni tlhelo lero saseka ra xivindzi, ni tinso hi timbirhi ka tona, ni mafurha ya kona, a tsema ni nenge wa xinene.	Then he took the fat and the fat tail and all the fat that was on the entrails and the long lobe of the liver and the two kidneys with their fat and the right thigh
Kutani exirhundzwini xa leswo-ke-comela leswi nga mahlweni ka HOSI Xikwembu, Muxe a pambula ximbhundzwa xin'we, ni xinkwa xin'we lexi totiweke mafurha, ni xinkwa xin'we lexo oma, a swi tlhandleka ehenhla ka mafurha ni nenge lowa xinene	and out of the basket of unleavened bread that was before the LORD he took one unleavened loaf and one loaf of bread with oil and one wafer and placed them on the pieces of fat and on the right thigh.
a swi teka hinkwaswo a khomisa Aroni ni vana va yena, leswaku va widzela HOSI Xikwembu swi va nyiko leyo hlawuleka.	And he put all these in the hands of Aaron and in the hands of his sons and waved them as a wave offering before the LORD.
Kutani Muxe a tlhela a swi teka emavokweni ya vona, a swi katsa ni magandzelo lama hisiwaka, ma nga ya ku vekiwa ka vaprista, kutani a swi hisa ehenhla ka alitari, yi va mhamba leyi hiseriwaka HOSI Xikwembu, leyi ku nun'hwela ka yona ku xi tsakisaka.	Then Moses took them from their hands and burned them on the altar with the burnt offering. This was an ordination offering with a pleasing aroma, a food offering to the LORD.
Kutani Muxe a teka xifuva, a widzela HOSI Xikwembu leswaku yi va nyiko ya xona leyo hlawuleka; xifuva lexi, hi xona xiphemu lexi Muxe a kumeke xona eka xifuwo lexi tlhaveriweke ku vekiwa ka vaprista, hilaha HOSI Xikwembu xi n'wi leriseke hakona.	And Moses took the breast and waved it for a wave offering before the LORD. It was Moses' portion of the ram of ordination, as the LORD commanded Moses.
Kutani Muxe a teka mafurhanyana yo tola ni ngatinyana eka leyi nga alitarini, a xuva Aroni ni vana va yena, ni swiambalo swa vona swa vuprista; hi ndlela leyi, Muxe a hlawulekisa Aroni ni vana va yena, ni swiambalo swa vona swa vuprista.	Then Moses took some of the anointing oil and of the blood that was on the altar and sprinkled it on Aaron and his garments, and also on his sons and his sons' garments. So he consecrated Aaron and his garments, and his sons and his sons' garments with him.
Kutani Muxe a byela Aroni ni vana va yena, a ku ka vona: Mi fanele ku sweka nyama enyangweni ya Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka, mi yi dyela kwalaho ni swinkwa leswi nga xirhundzwini xa magandzelo ya ku vekiwa ka n'wina, hilaha HOSI Xikwembu xi leriseke hakona, xi ku: ‘Swi ta dyiwa hi Aroni ni vana va yena.’	And Moses said to Aaron and his sons, Boil the flesh at the entrance of the tent of meeting, and there eat it and the bread that is in the basket of ordination offerings, as I commanded, saying, 'Aaron and his sons shall eat it.'
Nyama leyi nga ta sala ni swinkwa leswi nga ta sala, swi hiseni!	And what remains of the flesh and the bread you shall burn up with fire.
Ntirho wa ku vekiwa ka n'wina wu ta teka masiku ya 7; hikokwalaho mi nga tshuki mi suka enyangweni ya Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka, masiku lawa ya 7 ma kondza ma hela.	And you shall not go outside the entrance of the tent of meeting for seven days, until the days of your ordination are completed, for it will take seven days to ordain you.
Leswi endliweke namuntlha, hi swona leswi HOSI Xikwembu xi swi leriseke hi tlhelo ra ku basisiwa ka n'wina.	As has been done today, the LORD has commanded to be done to make atonement for you.
Hi masiku lawa ya 7, vusiku ni nhlekanhi, mi fanele ku tshama enyangweni ya Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka mi ri karhi mi endla leswi HOSI Xikwembu xi swi leriseke; loko swi nga ri tano, mi ta fa. Hi swona leswi ndzi nga lerisiwa swona.	At the entrance of the tent of meeting you shall remain day and night for seven days, performing what the LORD has charged, so that you do not die, for so I have been commanded.
Kutani Aroni ni vana va yena va endla hinkwaswo leswi HOSI Xikwembu xi va leriseke swona hi nomo wa Muxe.	And Aaron and his sons did all the things that the LORD commanded by Moses.
Hi siku ra vu-8, Muxe a vitana Aroni ni vana va yena, swin'we ni vakulukumba va Israele	On the eighth day Moses called Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel
kutani a ku ka Aroni: Tana ni xinkuzana xa mhamba yo susa swidyoho, ni khuna ra magandzelo lama hisiwaka, swi va leswo saseka hi swimbirhi ka swona, leswaku u ta swi humesela HOSI Xikwembu	and he said to Aaron, Take for yourself a bull calf for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering, both without blemish, and offer them before the LORD.
u byela ni Vaisraele leswaku va ta ni leswi: Xiphongho xa mhamba yo susa swidyoho, ni rhole ni xinyimpfana, swi va leswi nga solekiki swa lembe rin'we, swa magandzelo lama hisiwaka	And say to the people of Israel, 'Take a male goat for a sin offering, and a calf and a lamb, both a year old without blemish, for a burnt offering
ni homu ni khuna, swi va swa magandzelo ya xinakulobye lama nga ta humeseriwa HOSI Xikwembu, ni mapa ya magandzelo ya swa le masin'wini lama cheriweke mafurha. Leswi swa laveka, hikuva HOSI Xikwembu xi ta tikomba eka vona namuntlha.	and an ox and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD, and a grain offering mixed with oil, for today the LORD will appear to you.'
Kutani va ta ni leswi Muxe a va leriseke swona, va fika va yima emahlweni ka Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka; ntshungu hinkwawo wu hlengeletana emahlweni ka HOSI Xikwembu	And they brought what Moses commanded in front of the tent of meeting, and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD.
kutani Muxe a ku: HOSI Xikwembu xi mi lerisile ku endla leswi hinkwaswo leswaku ku kwetsima ka xona ku ta tikomba eka n'wina.	And Moses said, This is the thing that the LORD commanded you to do, that the glory of the LORD may appear to you.
Muxe a ku ka Aroni: Tshinela kusuhi ni alitari, u ta humesa mhamba ya wena yo susa swidyoho ni magandzelo ya wena lama hisiwaka, leswaku u tibasisa, u basisa ni Vaisraele. Kutani u ta humesa ni magandzelo ya Vaisraele, u va basisa ha wona, hilaha HOSI Xikwembu xi leriseke hakona.	Then Moses said to Aaron, Draw near to the altar and offer your sin offering and your burnt offering and make atonement for yourself and for the people, and bring the offering of the people and make atonement for them, as the LORD has commanded.
Kavaloko Aroni a tshinela kusuhi ni alitari, a tlhava xinkuzana xa mhamba ya yena yo susa swidyoho	So Aaron drew near to the altar and killed the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.
kutani vana va yena va n'wi kanga telela ngati, a peta ritiho ra yena engatini leyi, a yi tota etimhondzweni ta alitari; ngati leyin'wana a yi chela ehansi ka alitari	And the sons of Aaron presented the blood to him, and he dipped his finger in the blood and put it on the horns of the altar and poured out the blood at the base of the altar.
kutani a tsema mafurha ya xinkuzana xa mhamba yo susa swidyoho a tsema ni tinso ta xona, ni tlhelo lero saseka ra xivindzi, a swi hisa ehenhla ka alitari, hilaha HOSI Xikwembu xi leriseke hakona.	But the fat and the kidneys and the long lobe of the liver from the sin offering he burned on the altar, as the LORD commanded Moses.
Nyama ya xinkuzana lexi ni dzovo ra xona, a swi teka, a ya swi hisa ehandle ka mixaxa.	The flesh and the skin he burned up with fire outside the camp.
Kutani a tlhava xifuwo xa magandzelo lama hisiwaka; vana va yena va n'wi nyiketa ngati ya xona, kutani a xuva ha yona alitari matlhelo hinkwawo	Then he killed the burnt offering, and Aaron's sons handed him the blood, and he threw it against the sides of the altar.
va n'wi nyiketa ni nyama leyi tsemeleriweke ya xifuwo, ni nhloko ya xona, a swi hisa ehenhla ka alitari.	And they handed the burnt offering to him, piece by piece, and the head, and he burned them on the altar.
A a rhange a hlantswa swa le ndzeni ni manqina, kutani a swi hisa ehenhla ka alitari, swin'we ni nyama leyin'wana ya magandzelo.	And he washed the entrails and the legs and burned them with the burnt offering on the altar.
Kutani Aroni a humesa magandzelo ya Vaisraele: A ta ni xiphongho xa Vaisraele xa mhamba yo susa swidyoho, a xi tlhava, yi va mhamba ya vona yo susa swidyoho leyi fanaka ni ya yena.	Then he presented the people's offering and took the goat of the sin offering that was for the people and killed it and offered it as a sin offering, like the first one.
Kutani a humesa xifuwo xa magandzelo lama hisiwaka, a xi lulamisa hi nawu wa kona.	And he presented the burnt offering and offered it according to the rule.
Endzhaku ka swona, a humesa mapa ya magandzelo ya swa le masin'wini, a nusa yo tata xandla a ma hisa ehenhla ka alitari, a tlhandleka eka magandzelo lama hisiwaka ya nimixo.	And he presented the grain offering, took a handful of it, and burned it on the altar, besides the burnt offering of the morning.
Kutani a tlhava homu ni khuna, swi va swa magandzelo ya xinakulobye ya Vaisraele; vana va yena va n'wi nyiketa ngati, a xuva ha yona alitari matlhelo hinkwavo	Then he killed the ox and the ram, the sacrifice of peace offerings for the people. And Aaron's sons handed him the blood, and he threw it against the sides of the altar.
va teka ni mafurha ya homu ni ya khuna, ni ncila wa khuna, ni mpambani, ni tinso, ni tlhelo lero saseka ra xivindzi	But the fat pieces of the ox and of the ram, the fat tail and that which covers the entrails and the kidneys and the long lobe of the liver
va swi tlhandleka ehenhla ka nyama ya swifuva, kutani Aroni a hisa mafurha alitarini	they put the fat pieces on the breasts, and he burned the fat pieces on the altar
loko swi ri swifuva ni nenge wa xinene, Aroni a swi widzela HOSI Xikwembu, swi va nyiko leyo hlawuleka, hilaha Muxe a leriseke hakona.	but the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved for a wave offering before the LORD, as Moses commanded.
Loko Aroni a hetile ku humesa mhamba yo susa swidyoho, ni magandzelo lama hisiwaka, ni magandzelo ya xinakulobye, a tlakusa mavoko, a katekisa Vaisraele, kutani a xika alitarini.	Then Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them, and he came down from offering the sin offering and the burnt offering and the peace offerings.
Kavaloko Muxe na Aroni va nghena eka Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka. Loko va huma, va tlhela va katekisa Vaisraele, kutani ku kwetsima ka HOSI Xikwembu ku tikomba eka ntshungu hinkwawo.	And Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting, and when they came out they blessed the people, and the glory of the LORD appeared to all the people.
Kutani ku ta ndzilo lowu humaka eka HOSI Xikwembu, wu hisa nyama ya magandzelo ni mafurha hinkwawo ehenhla ka alitari. Loko Vaisraele va vona sweswo, va ba huwa leyikulu, kutani va nkhinsama, va korhamela hansi.	And fire came out from before the LORD and consumed the burnt offering and the pieces of fat on the altar, and when all the people saw it, they shouted and fell on their faces.
Siku rin'wana, Nadabu na Abihu, vana va Aroni, va teka swimbitana swa vona, va oka ndzilo, va chela ni murhi wa risuna, va humesela HOSI Xikwembu magandzelo; ndzilo lowu, a wu nga ri wona lowu HOSI Xikwembu xi va leriseke wona.	Now Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, each took his censer and put fire in it and laid incense on it and offered unauthorized fire before the LORD, which he had not commanded them.
Hiloko ku ta ndzilo lowu humaka eka HOSI Xikwembu, wu fika wu va hisa, va fela kwalaho mahlweni ka HOSI Xikwembu.	And fire came out from before the LORD and consumed them, and they died before the LORD.
Kutani Muxe a ku ka Aroni: Leswi hi swona HOSI Xikwembu a xi vula swona loko xi ku: ‘Lava va tshinelaka kusuhi na mina, va fanele ku ndzi chava, Vaisraele hinkwavo va fanele ku ndzi dzunisa.’  Loko a ri Aroni, a tikhoma a miyela.	Then Moses said to Aaron, This is what the LORD has said: 'Among those who are near me I will be sanctified, and before all the people I will be glorified.' And Aaron held his peace.
Kutani Muxe a vitana Mixaele na Elisafani, vana va Uziele makwa Aroni wa xinuna, a ku ka vona: Tanani, mi ta rhwala vamakwenu, mi va susa laha xivandleni lexo hlawuleka, mi va yisa ehandle ka mixaxa.	And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said to them, Come near; carry your brothers away from the front of the sanctuary and out of the camp.
Kavaloko va tshinela, va rhwala vamakwavo hi swiambalo swa vona, va va yisa ehandle ka mixaxa, hilaha Muxe a leriseke hakona.	So they came near and carried them in their coats out of the camp, as Moses had said.
Kutani Muxe a byela Aroni ni vana va yena Eliyazara na Itamara, a ku: Mi nga tshuki mi rila nkosi lowu; mi nga tshiki misisi ya n'wina yi hangalaka, kumbe ku handzulela swiambalo swa n'wina. Loko mo endla sweswo, mi ta fa, mi tlhela mi endla leswaku HOSI Xikwembu xi hlundzukela ntshungu hinkwawo. Loko va ri Vaisraele lavan'wana, vona va nga rila nkosi wa lava dlayiweke hi ndzilo lowu humaka eka HOSI Xikwembu.	And Moses said to Aaron and to Eleazar and Ithamar his sons, Do not let the hair of your heads hang loose, and do not tear your clothes, lest you die, and wrath come upon all the congregation; but let your brothers, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning that the LORD has kindled.
Naswona mi nga tshuki mi suka laha nyangweni ya Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka; loko mo suka, mi ta fa, hikuva mi totiwile mafurha ya HOSI Xikwembu. Kutani Aroni ni vana va yena va endla hilaha Muxe a va leriseke hakona.	And do not go outside the entrance of the tent of meeting, lest you die, for the anointing oil of the LORD is upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses.
HOSI Xikwembu xi vulavula na Aroni, xi ku	And the LORD spoke to Aaron, saying
Wena ni vana va wena, mi nga tshuki mi ya nghena eka Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka loko mi nwile vhinyo kumbe byala, hikuva mi nga fa. Nawu lowu mi fanele ku wu landzelela, n'wina ni vatukulu va n'wina, hilaha ku nga heriki.	Drink no wine or strong drink, you or your sons with you, when you go into the tent of meeting, lest you die. It shall be a statute forever throughout your generations.
Mi fanele ku tiva ku hambana exikarhi ka leswi hlawulekeke ni leswi nga hlawulekangiki, mi tiva ni ku hambana exikarhi ka leswi nyameke ni leswi tengeke.	You are to distinguish between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean
Naswona, mi fanele ku dyondzisa Vaisraele milawu hinkwayo leyi ndzi va byeleke yona hi nomo wa Muxe.	and you are to teach the people of Israel all the statutes that the LORD has spoken to them by Moses.
Kutani Muxe a vulavula na Aroni ni vana va yena lava saleke, Eliyazara na Itamara, a ku ka vona: Leswi swi saleke eka magandzelo ya swa le masin'wini lama hiseriweke HOSI Xikwembu, swi tekeni, mi ya swi dyela kusuhi ni alitari swi nga cheriwanga comela, hikuva swi hlawulekile ngopfu.	Moses spoke to Aaron and to Eleazar and Ithamar, his surviving sons: Take the grain offering that is left of the LORD's food offerings, and eat it unleavened beside the altar, for it is most holy.
Mi fanele ku swi dyela endhawini leyi hlawulekeke, wena ni vana va wena, hikuva i xiphemu lexi mi kumaka xona eka leswi hiseriwaka HOSI Xikwembu; sweswo hi leswi ndzi lerisiweke swona.	You shall eat it in a holy place, because it is your due and your sons' due, from the LORD's food offerings, for so I am commanded.
Kambe loko xi ri xifuva lexi widzeriweke HOSI Xikwembu ni nenge lowu wu humesiweke wu va nyiko, mi nga swi dyela endhawini yin'wana ni yin'wana leyi tengeke, wena ni vana va wena, hikuva swona i xiphemu lexi mi nyikiwaka xona, xi huma eka magandzelo ya xinakulobye ya Vaisraele.	But the breast that is waved and the thigh that is contributed you shall eat in a clean place, you and your sons and your daughters with you, for they are given as your due and your sons' due from the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the people of Israel.
Vaisraele va ta hamba va humesa nenge ni xifuva xa nyiko leyo hlawuleka, loko va tisa mafurha lama hisiwaka; xifuva xi ta widzeriwa HOSI Xikwembu, xi va nyiko leyo hlawuleka. Minkarhi hinkwayo, wena ni vana va wena, mi ta nyikiwa swilo leswi, hilaha HOSI Xikwembu xi leriseke hakona.	The thigh that is contributed and the breast that is waved they shall bring with the food offerings of the fat pieces to wave for a wave offering before the LORD, and it shall be yours and your sons' with you as a due forever, as the LORD has commanded.
Muxe a vutisa hi tlhelo ra xiphongho xa mhamba yo susa swidyoho, kutani a kuma leswaku xi hisiwile. Hiloko a hlundzukela Eliyazara na Itamara, vana va Aroni lava va ha saleke, a ku ka vona	Now Moses diligently inquired about the goat of the sin offering, and behold, it was burned up! And he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the surviving sons of Aaron, saying
Hikwalaho ka yini mi nga dyanga nyama ya xiphongho xa mhamba yo susa swidyoho, mi yi dyela exivandleni lexo hlawuleka, xana? Nyama ya mhamba leyi yi hlawulekile swinene; mi nyikiwile yona leswaku mi ta susa ha yona swidyoho swa ntshungu wa Vaisraele, mi va basisa emahlweni ka HOSI Xikwembu.	Why have you not eaten the sin offering in the place of the sanctuary, since it is a thing most holy and has been given to you that you may bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the LORD?
Leswi ngati ya xiphongho yi nga yisiwangiki endzeni ka Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka, a mi fanele mi dye nyama ya kona endzeni ka Ntsonga, exivandleni lexi hlawulekeke, hilaha ndzi mi leriseke hakona.	Behold, its blood was not brought into the inner part of the sanctuary. You certainly ought to have eaten it in the sanctuary, as I commanded.
Aroni a hlamula Muxe, a ku: Vona, namuntlha va humesile mhamba ya vona yo susa swidyoho, ni magandzelo ya vona lama hisiwaka emahlweni ka HOSI Xikwembu, kambe sweswo a swi sivelanga khombo leri ri ndzi humeleleke. Xana loko a ndzi lo dya nyama ya mhamba yo susa swidyoho namuntlha, a swi ta va swi tsakisile HOSI Xikwembu xana?	And Aaron said to Moses, Behold, today they have offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD, and yet such things as these have happened to me! If I had eaten the sin offering today, would the LORD have approved?
Loko Muxe a twa marito lawa, a nga ha vulanga nchumu.	And when Moses heard that, he approved.
HOSI Xikwembu xi byela Muxe na Aroni	And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying to them
ku ya vulavula ni Vaisraele, va va tivisa marito ya xona lama nge: Exikarhi ka swiharhi hinkwaswo leswi hanyaka laha misaveni, leswi mi nga swi dyaka hi leswi	Speak to the people of Israel, saying, These are the living things that you may eat among all the animals that are on the earth.

Hambiswiritano, exikarhi ka swiharhi leswi gayelaka kumbe leswi swinyondzwana swa swona swi avaneke, leswi mi nga fanelangiki ku swi dya hi leswi: I kamela; ya gayela, kambe eka n'wina a yi ve leyi nga tengangiki, hikuva a yi na swinyondzwana leswi avaneke	Nevertheless, among those that chew the cud or part the hoof, you shall not eat these: The camel, because it chews the cud but does not part the hoof, is unclean to you.
ni mbila; ya gayela, kambe eka n'wina a yi ve leyi nga tengangiki, hikuva a yi na swinyondzwana leswi avaneke	And the rock badger, because it chews the cud but does not part the hoof, is unclean to you.
ni mpfundla; wa gayela, kambe eka n'wina a wu ve lowu nga tengangiki, hikuva a wu na swinyondzwana leswi avaneke	And the hare, because it chews the cud but does not part the hoof, is unclean to you.
ni nguluve; yi ni swinyondzwana leswi avaneke hi le xikarhi, kambe eka n'wina a yi ve leyi nga tengangiki, hikuva a yi gayeli.	And the pig, because it parts the hoof and is cloven-footed but does not chew the cud, is unclean to you.
Mi nga tshuki mi dya nyama ya swiharhi leswi, ni loko swi file, mi nga tshuki mi swi khumba; eka n'wina a swi ve leswi nga tengangiki.	You shall not eat any of their flesh, and you shall not touch their carcasses; they are unclean to you.
Exikarhi ka swilo hinkwaswo leswi hanyaka ematini, ku nga va elwandle kumbe emilambyeni, mi nga dya ntsena leswi nga ni swicapila ni mahakatimba.	These you may eat, of all that are in the waters. Everything in the waters that has fins and scales, whether in the seas or in the rivers, you may eat.
Kambe hinkwaswo leswi hanyaka elwandle kumbe enambyeni, swihadyana leswitsongo kumbe swiharhi leswikulu, loko swi nga ri na swicapila ni mahakatimba, ku dya swona swa yila.	But anything in the seas or the rivers that does not have fins and scales, of the swarming creatures in the waters and of the living creatures that are in the waters, is detestable to you.
Minkarhi hinkwayo, ku dya nyama ya swona swi ta yila eka n'wina, hambi ku ri ku swi khumba loko swi file, swa yila.	You shall regard them as detestable; you shall not eat any of their flesh, and you shall detest their carcasses.
Ku dya xilo xihi na xihi lexi hanyaka ematini, lexi nga riki na swicapila ni mahakatimba, swa yila eka n'wina.	Everything in the waters that does not have fins and scales is detestable to you.
Exikarhi ka tinyanyana, leti ti yilaka ku ti dya hi leti: I magama, ni makoti, ni tinkhozi	And these you shall detest among the birds; they shall not be eaten; they are detestable: the eagle, the bearded vulture, the black vulture

Switsotswana hinkwaswo leswi nga ni timpapa ni milenge ya mune, ku dya swona swa yila eka n'wina.	All winged insects that go on all fours are detestable to you.
Eka swona, mi nga dya ntsena leswi nga ni tincondzo to tlula ha tona.	Yet among the winged insects that go on all fours you may eat those that have jointed legs above their feet, with which to hop on the ground.
Leswi mi nga swi dyaka hi leswi: Tinxaka hinkwato ta tinjiya to kota magerere, ni marhida, ni tithagavele, ni timherhavunguvungu.	Of them you may eat: the locust of any kind, the bald locust of any kind, the cricket of any kind, and the grasshopper of any kind.
Kambe switsotswana hinkwaswo leswi ngo va ni timpapa ni milenge ntsena, ku dya swona swa yila eka n'wina.	But all other winged insects that have four feet are detestable to you.
Swiharhi leswi hinkwaswo swi nga mi nyamisa; un'wana ni un'wana loyi a swi khumbaka loko swi file, siku rero ú ta va a nga tenganga ri ko ri pela	And by these you shall become unclean. Whoever touches their carcass shall be unclean until the evening

Whoever touches their carcass shall be unclean until the evening

Eka n'wina, swiharhi leswi a swi ve leswi nga tengangiki.	and he who carries their carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening; they are unclean to you.
Exikarhi ka swihadyana leswi tateke misava, leswi nga tengangiki eka n'wina hi leswi: Timfukuzani, ni makondlo, ni minkwahle hi tinxaka-xaka ta yona	And these are unclean to you among the swarming things that swarm on the ground: the mole rat, the mouse, the great lizard of any kind

HOSI Xikwembu xi byela Muxe	The LORD spoke to Moses, saying
ku ya vulavula ni Vaisraele, a ku ka vona: Loko wansati a tika, kutani a veleka n'wana wa mufana, wansati yoloye ú ta va nga tenganga ku ringana masiku ya 7; swi fana ni loko a nga tenganga emasikwini ya yena ya n'hweti.	Speak to the people of Israel, saying, If a woman conceives and bears a male child, then she shall be unclean seven days. As at the time of her menstruation, she shall be unclean.
Hi siku ra vu-8, n'wana ú fanele ku yimbisiwa.	And on the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.
Endzhaku ka sweswo, wansati loyi ú ta tshama masiku ya 33, a tibasisa hikwalaho ka ngati ya yena leyi humeke. Hi nkarhi lowu, a nga fanelanga ku khumba swilo leswi hlawulekeke, naswona a nga ngheni exivandleni lexi hlawulekeke, ku kondza masiku ya ku basisiwa ka yena ma hela.	Then she shall continue for thirty-three days in the blood of her purifying. She shall not touch anything holy, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying are completed.
Kasi loko wansati a veleka n'wana wa nhwanyana, ú ta va a nga tenganga ku ringana mavhiki mambirhi; swi fana ni loko a nga tenganga emasikwini ya yena ya n'hweti. Wansati loyi ú ta tshama masiku ya 66, a tibasisa hikwalaho ka ngati ya yena leyi humeke.	But if she bears a female child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her menstruation. And she shall continue in the blood of her purifying for sixty-six days.
Loko masiku ya ku basisiwa ka wansati la velekeke n'wana wa mufana kumbe wa nhwanyana ma ta va ma herile, wansati yoloye ú fanele ku lava xinyimpfana xa lembe rin'we xo humesa magandzelo lama hisiwaka, ni tuva kumbe vondlo ra tuva ro humesa mhamba yo susa swidyoho, kutani a ya na swona eka muprista enyangweni ya Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka.	And when the days of her purifying are completed, whether for a son or for a daughter, she shall bring to the priest at the entrance of the tent of meeting a lamb a year old for a burnt offering, and a pigeon or a turtledove for a sin offering
Muprista ú ta fika a swi humesa emahlweni ka HOSI Xikwembu, a basisa wansati loyi ha swona; kutani wansati ú ta va a tengile, endzhaku ka ku lahlekeriwa hi ngati. Lowu hi wona nawu hi tlhelo ra wansati loyi a kumaka n'wana wa mufana kumbe wa nhwanyana.	and he shall offer it before the LORD and make atonement for her. Then she shall be clean from the flow of her blood. This is the law for her who bears a child, either male or female.
Loko wansati wa kona a pfumala xinyimpfana, a nga ta ni matuva mambirhi kumbe mavondlo mambirhi ya matuva; rin'we ri ta va ra magandzelo lama hisiwaka, lerin'wana ri va ra mhamba yo susa swidyoho. Muprista ú ta basisa wansati hi matuva lawa, kutani wansati ú ta tlhela a va la tengeke.	And if she cannot afford a lamb, then she shall take two turtledoves or two pigeons, one for a burnt offering and the other for a sin offering. And the priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall be clean.
HOSI Xikwembu xi vulavula na Muxe na Aroni, xi ku ka vona	The LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying
Loko munhu a tshuka a va ni laha ku pfimbeke emirini wa yena, kumbe a huma xilondza kumbe xirhumbana, kutani swi vonaka onge o va ni vuvabyi bya nhlokonho, munhu loyi ú fanele ku yisiwa eka muprista Aroni kumbe eka un'wana wa vana va yena, va nga vaprista.	When a person has on the skin of his body a swelling or an eruption or a spot, and it turns into a case of leprous disease on the skin of his body, then he shall be brought to Aaron the priest or to one of his sons the priests
Muprista ú ta kambela laha ku vavaka kona enhlongeni. Loko voya bya laha ku nga ni xilondza byi sungula ku kwalala, ni loko xilondza xa kona xi tikomba xi entile, muprista loyi a n'wi kambeleke ú ta tivisa leswaku muvabyi loyi a nga ha tenganga.	and the priest shall examine the diseased area on the skin of his body. And if the hair in the diseased area has turned white and the disease appears to be deeper than the skin of his body, it is a case of leprous disease. When the priest has examined him, he shall pronounce him unclean.
Kambe loko xilondza xi ri ni muhlovo wo basa, xi tikomba xi nga entanga, ni loko voya byi nga kwalalanga, muprista ú ta lerisa muvabyi ku tshama masiku ya 7, a nga famba-fambi.	But if the spot is white in the skin of his body and appears no deeper than the skin, and the hair in it has not turned white, the priest shall shut up the diseased person for seven days.
Hi siku ra vu-7, muprista ú ta kambela muvabyi; loko a vona leswaku vuvabyi byi yimile, a byi nga ha hangalaki na miri, ú ta tlhela a lerisa muvabyi ku tshama masiku man'wana ya 7, a nga famba-fambi.	And the priest shall examine him on the seventh day, and if in his eyes the disease is checked and the disease has not spread in the skin, then the priest shall shut him up for another seven days.
Hi siku ra vu-7, muprista ú ta tlhela a n'wi kambela nakambe. Loko xilondza xi ri kusuhi ni ku hola, ni loko vuvabyi byi nga hangalakanga na miri, muprista ú ta tivisa leswaku muvabyi se ú tengile, a wo va ntungu ntsena. Hikokwalaho muvabyi ú fanele ku hlantswa swiambalo swa yena, kutani ú ta va a tengile.	And the priest shall examine him again on the seventh day, and if the diseased area has faded and the disease has not spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean; it is only an eruption. And he shall wash his clothes and be clean.
Kasi vuvabyi byi nga tshuka byi hangalaka ni miri, endzhaku ka loko muvabyi a yile a ya tikomba eka muprista kutani muprista a n'wi byela leswaku ú tengile. Loko swi ri tano, muvabyi ú fanele ku tlhelela eka muprista.	But if the eruption spreads in the skin, after he has shown himself to the priest for his cleansing, he shall appear again before the priest.
Loko muprista a n'wi kambela, kutani a kuma leswaku vuvabyi byi hangalakile ni miri, ú ta tivisa leswaku muvabyi a nga ha tenganga; ú na nhlokonho.	And the priest shall look, and if the eruption has spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a leprous disease.
Munhu loyi a khomiwaka hi vuvabyi bya nhlonge, ú fanele ku yisiwa eka muprista.	When a man is afflicted with a leprous disease, he shall be brought to the priest
Kutani muprista ú ta fika a n'wi kambela; loko kun'wana emirini wa munhu loyi ko va ni xilondza lexi pfimbeke xi tlhela xi boxeka, xi kwalarisa ni voya lebyi nga kwalaho	and the priest shall look. And if there is a white swelling in the skin that has turned the hair white, and there is raw flesh in the swelling
munhu loyi ú ta va a khomiwile hi vuvabyi bya ntsandza-vatshunguri bya nhlokonho, kutani muprista ú fanele ku tivisa leswaku munhu loyi a nga ha tenganga; kambe a nga n'wi siveli ku famba-famba, hikuva swi ta va swi tiveka leswaku muvabyi a nga tenganga.	it is a chronic leprous disease in the skin of his body, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean. He shall not shut him up, for he is unclean.
Vuvabyi lebyi bya nhlonge byi nga tshuka byi hangalaka, byi tata miri hinkwawo ku sukela enhlokweni ku ya fika eswikunwanini, hinkwako lomu muprista a kotaka ku ku vona.	And if the leprous disease breaks out in the skin, so that the leprous disease covers all the skin of the diseased person from head to foot, so far as the priest can see
Loko swi ri tano, muprista ú fanele ku tlhela a kambela muvabyi. Loko a kuma leswaku miri wa yena hinkwawo wu lo pomeriwa ntsena hi vuvabyi bya nhlonge, ú fanele ku tivisa leswaku muvabyi se ú tengile. Miri wa yena hinkwawo wu ta va wu kwalarile hi mhaka ya vuvabyi lebyi, kutani ú ta va a tengile.	then the priest shall look, and if the leprous disease has covered all his body, he shall pronounce him clean of the disease; it has all turned white, and he is clean.
Kambe loko munhu loyi a tshuka a va ni swilondza leswi boxekeke emirini, ú ta va a nga tenganga.	But when raw flesh appears on him, he shall be unclean.
Kutani muprista ú fanele ku tlhela a n'wi kambela; loko a kuma leswaku ú ni swilondza leswi boxekeke, ú fanele ku tivisa leswaku muvabyi a nga ha tenganga. Swilondza leswi boxekeke a swi tenganga.	And the priest shall examine the raw flesh and pronounce him unclean. Raw flesh is unclean, for it is a leprous disease.
Loko swilondza leswi swi hola swi hundzuka swi va swo basa, muvabyi ú fanele ku tlhelela eka muprista.	But if the raw flesh recovers and turns white again, then he shall come to the priest
Muprista ú ta fika a n'wi kambela, kutani loko a kuma leswaku swilondza swi horile, swi basile, ú fanele ku tivisa leswaku muvabyi ú tengile; munhu loyi ú ta va a tengile hakunene.	and the priest shall examine him, and if the disease has turned white, then the priest shall pronounce the diseased person clean; he is clean.
Munhu a nga tshuka a huma tshumba, kutani ri hola.	If there is in the skin of one's body a boil and it heals
Loko, laha a ku ri na tshumba, ku sala ku pfimba, ku kwalala, kumbe ku huma swirhumbana swo tshwukulukanyana, munhu loyi ú fanele ku ya komba muprista.	and in the place of the boil there comes a white swelling or a reddish-white spot, then it shall be shown to the priest.
Muprista ú ta n'wi kambela; kutani loko ndhawu ya kona yi tikomba yi entilenyana, ni loko voya lebyi nga kwalaho byi sungule ku kwalala, muprista ú ta tivisa leswaku munhu loyi a nga ha tenganga; ú ni nhlokonho, wu lo huma laha a ku ri ni tshumba.	And the priest shall look, and if it appears deeper than the skin and its hair has turned white, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is a case of leprous disease that has broken out in the boil.
Kambe loko muprista a kambela vuvabyi lebyi, kutani a kuma leswaku voya lebyi nga kwalaho a byi kwalalanga, ni leswaku ndhawu ya kona a yi entanga ngopfu, naswona yi le kusuhi ni ku hola, ú ta lerisa muvabyi ku tshama masiku ya 7 a nga famba-fambi.	But if the priest examines it and there is no white hair in it and it is not deeper than the skin, but has faded, then the priest shall shut him up seven days.
Loko vuvabyi byi sungula ku hangalaka ni miri, muprista ú ta tivisa leswaku muvabyi a nga tenganga, wa ha vabya.	And if it spreads in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a disease.
Kambe loko swirhumbana swo tshamisa sweswo swi nga hangalaki ni miri, xi to va xi ri xivati ntsena lexi vangiweke hi tshumba, kutani muprista ú ta tivisa leswaku muvabyi ú tengile.	But if the spot remains in one place and does not spread, it is the scar of the boil, and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
Naswona munhu a nga tshuka a tshwa kun'wana emirini wa yena, kutani ku huma xilondza xo tshwukulukanyana kumbe xo basa.	Or, when the body has a burn on its skin and the raw flesh of the burn becomes a spot, reddish-white or white
Loko swi va tano, muprista ú ta kambela xilondza; loko xi kwalarisile voya lebyi nga kwalaho, ni loko xi entile, munhu loyi ú ni vuvabyi bya nhlokonho, wu lo huma laha ku nga tshwa; muprista ú ta tivisa leswaku muvabyi a nga ha tenganga, ú ni nhlokonho.	the priest shall examine it, and if the hair in the spot has turned white and it appears deeper than the skin, then it is a leprous disease. It has broken out in the burn, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a case of leprous disease.
Kambe loko muprista a kambela xilondza, kutani a kuma leswaku a xi kwalarisanga voya lebyi nga kwalaho, ni leswaku a xi entanga, xi le kusuhi ni ku hola, ú ta lerisa muvabyi ku tshama masiku ya 7 a nga famba-fambi	But if the priest examines it and there is no white hair in the spot and it is no deeper than the skin, but has faded, the priest shall shut him up seven days
hi siku ra vu-7, muprista ú fanele ku tlhela a n'wi kambela; loko a kuma leswaku vuvabyi byi sungule ku hangalaka ni miri, muprista ú ta tivisa leswaku muvabyi a nga ha tenganga, ú ni vuvabyi bya nhlokonho.	and the priest shall examine him the seventh day. If it is spreading in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a case of leprous disease.
Kambe loko xilondza xi tshamisa sweswo, xi nga hangalaki ni miri, naswona xi ri kusuhi ni ku hola, nhlonge yi lo pfimbisiwa ntsena hi ku tshwa, kutani muprista ú ta tivisa leswaku muvabyi ú tengile, ú lo sala ni xivati ntsena laha ku tshweke.	But if the spot remains in one place and does not spread in the skin, but has faded, it is a swelling from the burn, and the priest shall pronounce him clean, for it is the scar of the burn.
Loko wanuna kumbe wansati a ri ni xirhumbana enhlokweni kumbe exilebvini	When a man or woman has a disease on the head or the beard
muprista ú fanele ku kambela xirhumbana xa kona. Loko xi vangile xilondza lexi enteke, ni loko misisi leyi nga kwalaho yi ri ya xitshopani yi tlhela yi lala, muprista ú ta tivisa leswaku muvabyi loyi a nga tenganga, ú khomiwile hi vuvabyi byo n'wayisa bya nhlokonho wa le nhlokweni kumbe exilebvini.	the priest shall examine the disease. And if it appears deeper than the skin, and the hair in it is yellow and thin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is an itch, a leprous disease of the head or the beard.
Loko Muprista a kambela swirhumbana leswi swo n'wayisa, kutani a kuma swi nga entanga ngopfu, naswona ku nga ri na voya bya ntima kwalaho, ú fanele ku lerisa muvabyi ku tshama masiku ya 7 a nga famba-fambi.	And if the priest examines the itching disease and it appears no deeper than the skin and there is no black hair in it, then the priest shall shut up the person with the itching disease for seven days
Hi siku ra vu-7, muprista ú ta tlhela a kambela muvabyi. Loko swirhumbana leswo n'wayisa swi nga hangalakanga ni miri, ni loko ku nga ri na voya bya xitshopani kwalaho, ni loko swirhumbana swi tikomba swi nga entanga	and on the seventh day the priest shall examine the disease. If the itch has not spread, and there is in it no yellow hair, and the itch appears to be no deeper than the skin
muvabyi ú fanele ku tibyewula, kambe a nga tshuki a byewula laha ku nga ni swirhumbana swo n'wayisa. Muprista ú fanele ku tlhela a lerisa muvabyi ku tshama masiku ya 7 a nga famba-fambi.	then he shall shave himself, but the itch he shall not shave; and the priest shall shut up the person with the itching disease for another seven days.
Hi siku ra vu-7, muprista ú fanele ku tlhela a kambela muvabyi loyi wa swirhumbana swo n'wayisa, kutani loko swi nga hangalakanga ni miri, ni loko swi tikomba swi nga entanga, muprista ú ta tivisa leswaku muvabyi loyi se ú tengile. Muvabyi ú ta hlantswa swiambalo swa yena, kutani ú ta va a tengile.	And on the seventh day the priest shall examine the itch, and if the itch has not spread in the skin and it appears to be no deeper than the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean. And he shall wash his clothes and be clean.
Swirhumbana swi nga tshuka swi hangalaka ni miri endzhaku ka loko muvabyi a basisiwile.	But if the itch spreads in the skin after his cleansing
Loko swo va tano, muprista ú ta tlhela a kambela muvabyi loyi, kutani loko hakunene swirhumbana swi hangalakile ni miri, muprista a nga ha tikarhati a languta loko ku ri ni voya bya xitshopani. Muvabyi ú ta va a nga ha tenganga.	then the priest shall examine him, and if the itch has spread in the skin, the priest need not seek for the yellow hair; he is unclean.
Kambe loko muprista a languta, kutani a vona leswaku laha a ku ri ni swirhumbana ku mirile voya bya ntima, swirhumbana sweswo swi ta va swi horile; muvabyi ú ta va a tengile, kutani muprista ú fanele ku tivisa leswaku muvabyi se ú tengile.	But if in his eyes the itch is unchanged and black hair has grown in it, the itch is healed and he is clean, and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
Loko wanuna kumbe wansati a tshuka a va ni mavala-valanyana yo basa emirini wa yena	When a man or a woman has spots on the skin of the body, white spots
muprista ú fanele ku n'wi kambela. Loko mavalavala ya kona ma nga basanga ngopfu, swi ta va swo va swirhumbana ntsena, kutani munhu yoloye ú ta va a tengile.	the priest shall look, and if the spots on the skin of the body are of a dull white, it is leukoderma that has broken out in the skin; he is clean.
Loko munhu a tshuka a suke misisi, a sala a ri ni mpandla, ú ta va a ha tengile.	If a man's hair falls out from his head, he is bald; he is clean.
Mpandla lowu wu nga va kusuhi ni mombo, kumbe exikosini, munhu yoloye ú ta va a ha tengile.	And if a man's hair falls out from his forehead, he has baldness of the forehead; he is clean.
Kambe laha ku nga ni mpandla, emahlweni kumbe exikosini, ku nga tshuka ku huma xilondza xo tshwukulukanyana; xexo xi nga va xikombiso xa ku huma ka nhlokonho	But if there is on the bald head or the bald forehead a reddish-white diseased area, it is a leprous disease breaking out on his bald head or his bald forehead.
kutani muprista ú fanele ku kambela munhu yoloye; loko xilondza lexi xi humeke empandleni xo va xo tshwukulukanyana ku fana ni nhlokonho lowu wu humaka emirini	Then the priest shall examine him, and if the diseased swelling is reddish-white on his bald head or on his bald forehead, like the appearance of leprous disease in the skin of the body
munhu yoloye ú vabya nhlokonho, kutani a nga tenanga. Muprista ú fanele ku tivisa leswaku muvabyi a nga ha tenganga, ú ni nhlokonho enhlokweni ya yena.	he is a leprous man, he is unclean. The priest must pronounce him unclean; his disease is on his head.
Munhu loyi a khomiweke hi vuvabyi bya nhlokonho, ú fanele ku ambala switlakati, a tshika ni misisi yi hangalaka, a funengeta ni nomo wa le henhla, a huwelela a ku: A ndzi tenganga! A ndzi tenganga!	The leprous person who has the disease shall wear torn clothes and let the hair of his head hang loose, and he shall cover his upper lip and cry out, 'Unclean, unclean.'
Munhu loyi a nga tenganga; loko a ha vabya, ú ta va a nga tenganga; ú fanele ku tshama a ri yexe ehandle ka mixaxa.	He shall remain unclean as long as he has the disease. He is unclean. He shall live alone. His dwelling shall be outside the camp.
Xiambalo xi nga tshuka xi va ni nkurhe; xi nga va xi lukiwile hi voya bya tinyimpfu kumbe hi ntsembyani	When there is a case of leprous disease in a garment, whether a woolen or a linen garment
nkurhe wolowo wu nga va etingotini to luka ha tona ta ntsembyani kumbe ta voya, kumbe edzobyeni, kumbe eka xilo xin'wana lexi endliweke hi voya.	in warp or woof of linen or wool, or in a skin or in anything made of skin
Loko xiambalo, kumbe tingoti to luka ha tona, kumbe dzovo, kumbe xin'wana xa dzovo, swi ri ni mavala ya rihlazanyana kumbe yo tshwukulukanyana, sweswo swi komba nkurhe, kutani swi fanele ku ya kombiwa muprista.	if the disease is greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin or in the warp or the woof or in any article made of skin, it is a case of leprous disease, and it shall be shown to the priest.
Muprista ú ta fika a kambela xilo lexi xi nga ni nkurhe, kutani a xi veka tlhelo masiku ya 7.	And the priest shall examine the disease and shut up that which has the disease for seven days.
Kutani, hi siku ra vu-7, muprista ú ta tlhela a kambela nkurhe; loko wu sungurile ku hangalaka ni xiambalo, kumbe tingoti to luka ha tona, kumbe dzovo, kumbe xin'wana xa leswi endliweke hi dzovo, sweswo swi komba nkurhe lowu nga ha sukiki, kutani xilo lexi xi nga ni nkurhe lowu, xi ta va xi nga tenganga.	Then he shall examine the disease on the seventh day. If the disease has spread in the garment, in the warp or the woof, or in the skin, whatever be the use of the skin, the disease is a persistent leprous disease; it is unclean.
Hikokwalaho, muprista ú fanele ku hisa xiambalo xa kona, kumbe tingoti ta kona ta voya kumbe ta ntsembyani, kumbe dzovo ra kona, kumbe swilo sweswo swin'wana swa dzovo; leswi swilo leswi swi nga ni nkurhe lowu nga ha sukiki, swi fanele ku hisiwa hi ndzilo.	And he shall burn the garment, or the warp or the woof, the wool or the linen, or any article made of skin that is diseased, for it is a persistent leprous disease. It shall be burned in the fire.
Kumbe loko muprista a kambela nkurhe, a nga tshuka a kuma leswaku a wu hangalakanga ni xiambalo, kumbe tingoti, kumbe swin'wana swa dzovo.	And if the priest examines, and if the disease has not spread in the garment, in the warp or the woof or in any article made of skin
Loko swi ri tano, ú ta lerisa leswaku swilo leswi swi nga ni nkurhe, swi hlantswiwa, kutani a swi veka tlhelo masiku man'wana ya 7.	then the priest shall command that they wash the thing in which is the disease, and he shall shut it up for another seven days.
Loko swilo swa kona leswi nga ni nkurhe swi ta va swi hlantswiwile, muprista ú ta tlhela a swi kambela nakambe, loko muhlovo wa nkurhe wu nga hundzukanga, xilo lexi xi nga na wona a xi si va lexi tengeke, hambi loko nkurhe wu nga si hangalaka na xona. Xilo xa kona xi fanele ku hisiwa, hambiloko nkurhe wu ri tlhelo rin'we ntsena ra xona.	And the priest shall examine the diseased thing after it has been washed. And if the appearance of the diseased area has not changed, though the disease has not spread, it is unclean. You shall burn it in the fire, whether the rot is on the back or on the front.
Kambe loko muprista a kambela nkurhe, kutani a kuma leswaku wa hela hileswi wu hlantswiweke, ú ta tsema ndhawu leyi a wu ri eka yona exiambalweni, kumbe edzobyeni, kumbe etingotini.	But if the priest examines, and if the diseased area has faded after it has been washed, he shall tear it out of the garment or the skin or the warp or the woof.
Loko wo tlhela wu vonaka nakambe exiambalweni, kumbe etingotini, kumbe edzobyeni, wa ha hangalaka ni xilo xa kona, kutani mi fanele ku hisa xilo lexi nga ni nkurhe wolowo.	Then if it appears again in the garment, in the warp or the woof, or in any article made of skin, it is spreading. You shall burn with fire whatever has the disease.
Kasi loko mi hlantswa xiambalo xa kona, kumbe tingoti ta kona, kumbe xilo xa kona xa dzovo, kutani nkurhe wu suka, mi fanele ku xi hlantswa ra vumbirhi; hikona xi nga ta va xi tengile.	But the garment, or the warp or the woof, or any article made of skin from which the disease departs when you have washed it, shall then be washed a second time, and be clean.
Loko mi lava ku tiva leswaku xilo xo karhi xi tengile kumbe a xi tenganga, xi nga va xiambalo xa voya kumbe xa ntsembyani, kumbe tingoti to luka ha tona, kumbe xilo xin'wana xa dzovo, nawu wa kona hi wona wolowo.	This is the law for a case of leprous disease in a garment of wool or linen, either in the warp or the woof, or in any article made of skin, to determine whether it is clean or unclean.
HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe	The LORD spoke to Moses, saying
Leswi faneleke ku endliwa siku leri ku basisiwaka munhu loyi a a ri ni vuvabyi bya nhlokonho, hi leswi: Munhu wa kona ú fanele ku yisiwa eka muprista	This shall be the law of the leprous person for the day of his cleansing. He shall be brought to the priest
kutani muprista ú ta n'wi teka a ya n'wi kambela ehandle ka mixaxa. Loko muvabyi a nga ha ri na wona nhlokonho	and the priest shall go out of the camp, and the priest shall look. Then, if the case of leprous disease is healed in the leprous person
muprista ú ta lerisa leswaku munhu loyi a lavaka ku basisiwa, a tiseriwa tinyanyana timbirhi to hanya leti tengeke, ni ximhandzana xa murhi wa kedari, ni ngoti ya muhlovo wo tshwuka, ni rhavi ra ximudyana xa hisopa.	the priest shall command them to take for him who is to be cleansed two live clean birds and cedarwood and scarlet yarn and hyssop.
Muprista ú ta tlhela a lerisa leswaku yin'wana ya tinyanyana ta kona yi dlayeriwa enkambanini lowu nga ni mati yo basa.	And the priest shall command them to kill one of the birds in an earthenware vessel over fresh water.
Kutani muprista ú ta teka xinyanyana lexo hanya, ni ximhandzana xa murhi wa kedari, ni ngoti ya muhlovo wo tshwuka, ni rhavi ra ximudyana xa hisopa, a swi peta engatini ya xinyanyana lexi nga dlayeriwa ematini layo basa.	He shall take the live bird with the cedarwood and the scarlet yarn and the hyssop, and dip them and the live bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the fresh water.
Kutani ngati leyi, muprista ú ta xuva munhu loyi ka 7 ha yona, kutani a tivisa leswaku muvabyi se ú tengile, a tshika ni xinyanyana lexo hanya xi haha xi tiyela enhoveni.	And he shall sprinkle it seven times on him who is to be cleansed of the leprous disease. Then he shall pronounce him clean and shall let the living bird go into the open field.
Kutani munhu loyi a basisiweke, ú ta hlantswa swiambalo swa yena, a byewula ni misisi hinkwayo, a tlhela a hlamba ni miri, kutani ú ta va la tengeke. Endzhaku ka sweswo, a nga ha vuya emixaxeni, kambe a nga fanelanga ku nghena entsongeni wa yena ku ringana masiku ya 7.	And he who is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes and shave off all his hair and bathe himself in water, and he shall be clean. And after that he may come into the camp, but live outside his tent seven days.
Hi siku ra vu-7, ú fanele ku tlhela a byewula misisi hinkwayo, ni malebvu, ni tinxiyi, ni voya hinkwabyo emirini wa yena, a hlantswa ni swiambalo swa yena, a hlamba ni miri; hikona a nga ta va a tengile.	And on the seventh day he shall shave off all his hair from his head, his beard, and his eyebrows. He shall shave off all his hair, and then he shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water, and he shall be clean.
Hi siku ra vu-8, munhu loyi ú ta ta ni swinyimpfana swimbirhi swa makhuna leswi nga solekiki, ni xinyimpfana xa thokazi xa lembe rin'we lexi nga solekiki, ni xitshatshana xin'we xa mapa lamanene, ma nga mapa ya magandzelo ya swa le masin'wini lama pfanganyisiweke ni mafurha; naswona ú ta ta ni xikhudzanyana xin'we xa mafurha man'wana.	And on the eighth day he shall take two male lambs without blemish, and one ewe lamb a year old without blemish, and a grain offering of three tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil, and one log of oil.
Muprista loyi a nga ku basiseni ka munhu loyi, ú ta n'wi teka, swin'we ni swilo leswi, a n'wi yisa emahlweni ka HOSI Xikwembu enyangweni ya Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka.	And the priest who cleanses him shall set the man who is to be cleansed and these things before the LORD, at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
Kutani muprista ú ta tlhava xin'wana xa swinyimpfana leswa makhuna xi va xa magandzelo yo riha milandzu, a humesa nyama ya kona swin'we ni mafurha lawa ya le xikhudzeni a widzela HOSI Xikwembu, swi va nyiko ya xona leyo hlawuleka.	And the priest shall take one of the male lambs and offer it for a guilt offering, along with the log of oil, and wave them for a wave offering before the LORD.
Xinyimpfana lexi, ú fanele ku xi tlhavela exivandleni lexo hlawuleka laha va tlhavelaka kona swifuwo swa mhamba yo susa swidyoho ni swa magandzelo lama hisiwaka. Nyama ya xifuwo xa magandzelo yo riha milandzu, a yi hambananga ni ya mhamba yo susa swidyoho, na yona yi hlawulekile swinene, kutani i ya vaprista.	And he shall kill the lamb in the place where they kill the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the place of the sanctuary. For the guilt offering, like the sin offering, belongs to the priest; it is most holy.
Kutani muprista ú ta teka ngatinyana ya xifuwo lexi xa magandzelo yo riha milandzu, a tota munhu loyi a basisiwaka emakumu ka ndleve ya xinene, ni le khudzwini ra voko ra xinene, ni le khudzwini ra nenge wa xinene.	The priest shall take some of the blood of the guilt offering, and the priest shall put it on the lobe of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot.
Muprista ú ta chulula mafurhanyana eka lawa ya le xikhudzeni, a ma chela exandleni xa voko ra yena ra ximatsi	Then the priest shall take some of the log of oil and pour it into the palm of his own left hand
kutani a peta ritiho rin'wana ra voko ra yena lera xinene emafurheni lawa ka 7, a ri karhi a ma n'watseka emahlweni ka HOSI Xikwembu.	and dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand and sprinkle some oil with his finger seven times before the LORD.
Muprista ú ta teka mafurha man'wana eka lama saleke exandleni xa yena, a tota loyi a basisiwaka emakumu ka ndleve ya yena ya xinene, ni le khudzwini ra voko ra xinene, ni le khudzwini ra nenge wa xinene; ú ta ma tota laha a toteke kona ngati ya xifuwo xa magandzelo yo riha milandzu.	And some of the oil that remains in his hand the priest shall put on the lobe of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot, on top of the blood of the guilt offering.
Mafurha hinkwawo lama saleke exandleni xa muprista, ú fanele ku ma chela enhlokweni ya loyi a basisiwaka. Hi ndlela leyi, muprista ú ta basisa munhu loyi emahlweni ka HOSI Xikwembu.	And the rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall put on the head of him who is to be cleansed. Then the priest shall make atonement for him before the LORD.
Muprista ú ta humesa ni mhamba yo susa swidyoho, a basisa ha yona munhu loyi a nga tengangiki. Endzhaku ka sweswo, muprista ú ta tlhava xifuwo xa magandzelo lama hisiwaka	The priest shall offer the sin offering, to make atonement for him who is to be cleansed from his uncleanness. And afterward he shall kill the burnt offering.

Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi byela Muxe na Aroni, xi ku	The LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying

When you come into the land of Canaan, which I give you for a possession, and I put a case of leprous disease in a house in the land of your possession
Loko swi va tano, n'wini wa yindlu ya kona ú fanele ku ya vikela muprista, a ku: ‘Ku ni swin'wana swo fana ni nkurhe endlwini ya mina.’	then he who owns the house shall come and tell the priest, 'There seems to me to be some case of disease in my house.'
Kutani muprista ú ta lerisa leswaku nhundzu hinkwayo leyi nga ndlwini yoleyo yi humesiwa, a nga si nghena a kambela nkurhe, hikuva loko nhundzu yi nga humesiwi, hinkwayo yi nga katsiwa ni leswi nga tengangiki. Kutani muprista ú ta nghena ndlwini.	Then the priest shall command that they empty the house before the priest goes to examine the disease, lest all that is in the house be declared unclean. And afterward the priest shall go in to see the house.

Hi siku ra vu-7, muprista ú ta tlhela a ya kambela yindlu; loko nkurhe wu lo hangalaka ni khumbi ra yindlu	And the priest shall come again on the seventh day, and look. If the disease has spread in the walls of the house
muprista ú fanele ku lerisa leswaku maribye lama nga ni nkurhe ma susiwa ekhumbini, ma ya cukumetiwa ehandle ka muti exivandleni xo chela leswi nga tengangiki.	then the priest shall command that they take out the stones in which is the disease and throw them into an unclean place outside the city.
Tlhandlakambirhi, muprista ú ta lerisa leswaku khumbi ra yindlu ri hariwa hinkwaro, misava ya kona yi rhwariwa yi ya halatiwa ehandle ka muti, exivandleni xo chela leswi nga tengangiki.	And he shall have the inside of the house scraped all around, and the plaster that they scrape off they shall pour out in an unclean place outside the city.
Kutani ku ta laviwa maribye man'wana, ma ta siva lama susiweke ekhumbini; khumbi na rona ri fanele ku tlhela ri phamiwa hi vuntshwa.	Then they shall take other stones and put them in the place of those stones, and he shall take other plaster and plaster the house.
Nkurhe wu nga tshuka wu hangalaka ni yindlu hambiloko maribye ma susiwile ni loko khumbi ri hariwile ri tlhela ri phamiwa nakambe.	If the disease breaks out again in the house, after he has taken out the stones and scraped the house and plastered it

And if the disease has spread in the house, it is a persistent leprous disease in the house; it is unclean.
Kutani yindlu ya kona yi fanele ku mbundzumuxiwa, maribye ni misava yo phama swi wela hansi, ku susiwa ni timhandze, kutani swi rhwariwa swi ya cukumetiwa ehandle ka muti, exivandleni lexi ku cheriwaka kona leswi nga tengangiki.	And he shall break down the house, its stones and timber and all the plaster of the house, and he shall carry them out of the city to an unclean place.
Munhu loyi a nghenaka endzeni ka yindlu leyi enkarhini lowu yi pfariweke, siku rero ú ta va a nga tenganga dyambu ri kondza ri ya pela	Moreover, whoever enters the house while it is shut up shall be unclean until the evening

HOSI Xikwembu xi byela Muxe na Aroni	The LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying
ku ya vulavula ni Vaisraele, va ku ka vona: Loko wanuna o tshuka a va ni ndzhundzhwana, ú ta va la nga tengangiki.	Speak to the people of Israel and say to them, When any man has a discharge from his body, his discharge is unclean.
Kutani leswi humelelaka eka wanuna loyi a nga ni ndzhundzhwana, hi leswi: Wanuna wa kona ú ta va a nga tenganga, hambiloko ndzhundzhwana wu huma kunene, kumbe wu n'wi pfala hala mahlweni.	And this is the law of his uncleanness for a discharge: whether his body runs with his discharge, or his body is blocked up by his discharge, it is his uncleanness.
Mubedo wihi ni wihi lowu munhu wa ndzhundzhwana a etlelaka eka wona, ni xitshamu xihi ni xihi lexi a tshamaka eka xona, swi ta va swi nga ha tenganga.	Every bed on which the one with the discharge lies shall be unclean, and everything on which he sits shall be unclean.
Munhu un'wana ni un'wana loyi a khumbaka mubedo wa kona, ú fanele ku hlantswa swiambalo swa yena, a tlhela a hlamba ni miri; hambiswiritano, siku rero ú ta va a nga tenganga, dyambu ri ko ri pela.	And anyone who touches his bed shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the evening.
Naswona munhu loyi a tshamaka exitshan'wini lexi munhu wa ndzhundzhwana a tshameke eka xona, ú fanele ku hlantswa swiambalo swa yena, a tlhela a hlamba ni miri; hambiswiritano, siku rero ú ta va a nga tenganga, dyambu ri ko ri pela.	And whoever sits on anything on which the one with the discharge has sat shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the evening.
Na yena munhu loyi a khumbaka miri wa loyi a nga ni ndzhundzhwana, ú fanele ku hlantswa swiambalo swa yena, a tlhela a hlamba ni miri; hambiswiritano, siku rero ú ta va a nga tenganga, dyambu ri ko ri pela.	And whoever touches the body of the one with the discharge shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the evening.
Loko munhu wa ndzhundzhwana a tshwutela munhu la tengeke, loyi a tshwuteriweke ú fanele ku hlantswa swiambalo swa yena, a tlhela a hlamba ni miri; hambiswiritano, siku rero ú ta va a nga tenganga, dyambu ri ko ri pela.	And if the one with the discharge spits on someone who is clean, then he shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the evening.
Xitshamu xin'wana ni xin'wana lexi munhu wa ndzhundzhwana a tshameke eka xona loko a gada xifuwo, xi ta va xi nga ha tenganga.	And any saddle on which the one with the discharge rides shall be unclean.
Munhu un'wana ni un'wana la khumbaka xilo lexi munhu wa ndzhundzhwana a tshameke eka xona, ú ta va a nga tenganga, dyambu ri ko ri pela; naswona loyi a rhwalaka xilo xo tano, ú fanele ku hlantswa swiambalo swa yena, a tlhela a hlamba ni miri; hambiswiritano, siku rero ú ta va a nga tenganga, dyambu ri ko ri pela.	And whoever touches anything that was under him shall be unclean until the evening. And whoever carries such things shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the evening.
Un'wana ni un'wana loyi a khomiwaka hi munhu wa ndzhundzhwana la nga hlambangiki mavoko, ú fanele ku hlantswa swiambalo swa yena, a tlhela a hlamba ni miri; hambiswiritano, siku rero ú ta va a nga tenganga, dyambu ri ko ri pela.	Anyone whom the one with the discharge touches without having rinsed his hands in water shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the evening.
Swibya swa vumba leswi munhu wa ndzhundzhwana a swi khumbeke, swi fanele ku fayiwa; kasi, swo vatliwa kunene swi fanele ku hlantswiwa.	And an earthenware vessel that the one with the discharge touches shall be broken, and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water.
Munhu loyi ndzhundzhwana wa yena wu yimeke, ú fanele ku hlaya masiku ya 7 ku sukela loko a horile, kutani a hlantswa swiambalo swa yena, a tlhela a hlamba ni miri hi mati layo basa; hi kona a nga ta va a tengile.	And when the one with a discharge is cleansed of his discharge, then he shall count for himself seven days for his cleansing, and wash his clothes. And he shall bathe his body in fresh water and shall be clean.

And on the eighth day he shall take two turtledoves or two pigeons and come before the LORD to the entrance of the tent of meeting and give them to the priest.
Kutani muprista ú ta humesa matuva lawa, rin'we ri va ra mhamba yo susa swidyoho, lerin'wana ri va ra magandzelo lama hisiwaka. Hi ndlela leyi, muprista ú ta basisa munhu wa ndzhundzhwana emahlweni ka HOSI Xikwembu.	And the priest shall use them, one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering. And the priest shall make atonement for him before the LORD for his discharge.
Loko wanuna o tshuka a huma mbewu ya ku veleka, ú fanele ku hlamba miri hinkwawo; hambiswiritano, siku rero ú ta va a nga tenganga, dyambu ri ko ri pela.	If a man has an emission of semen, he shall bathe his whole body in water and be unclean until the evening.
Naswona xilo xin'wana ni xin'wana lexi khumbeke mbewu ya kona, hambi xiambalo kumbe dzovo, xi fanele ku hlantswiwa; hambiswiritano, siku rero xi ta va xi nga tenganga, dyambu ri ko ri pela.	And every garment and every skin on which the semen comes shall be washed with water and be unclean until the evening.
Loko wanuna a etlela ni wansati, va fanele ku hlamba hi vumbirhi bya vona; hambiswiritano, siku rero va ta va va nga tenganga, dyambu ri ko ri pela.	If a man lies with a woman and has an emission of semen, both of them shall bathe themselves in water and be unclean until the evening.
Loko wansati a ri emasikwini ya yena ya n'hweti, a huma ngati, ú ta va a nyamile ku ringana masiku ya 7. Munhu un'wana ni un'wana loyi a khumbaka wansati loyi, siku rero ú ta va a nga tenganga, dyambu ri ko ri pela.	When a woman has a discharge, and the discharge in her body is blood, she shall be in her menstrual impurity for seven days, and whoever touches her shall be unclean until the evening.
Xilo xin'wana ni xin'wana lexi wansati loyi a etlelaka eka xona kumbe ku tshama eka xona emasikwini ya yena ya n'hweti, xi ta hundzuka lexi nga tengangiki.	And everything on which she lies during her menstrual impurity shall be unclean. Everything also on which she sits shall be unclean.
Naswona un'wana ni un'wana loyi a khumbaka mubedo wa wansati wo tano, ú fanele ku hlantswa swiambalo swa yena, a tlhela a hlamba ni miri; hambiswiritano, siku rero ú ta va a nga tenganga, dyambu ri ko ri pela.	And whoever touches her bed shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the evening.
Hambi a ri munhu loyi a khumbaka laha wansati loyi a tshameke kona, ú fanele ku hlantswa swiambalo swa yena, a tlhela a hlamba ni miri; hambiswiritano, siku rero ú ta va a nga tenganga, dyambu ri ko ri pela.	And whoever touches anything on which she sits shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the evening.
Munhu a nga va a khumbile xilo emubedweni wa wansati loyi kumbe exitshan'wini xa yena; siku rero ú ta va a nga tenganga, dyambu ri ko ri pela.	Whether it is the bed or anything on which she sits, when he touches it he shall be unclean until the evening.
Loko wanuna a tshuka a etlela ni wansati loyi, na yena ú ta va loyi a nyameke, kutani ú ta va a nga tenganga ku ringana masiku ya 7; hambi wu ri mubedo lowu a etlelaka eka wona, wu ta va wu nga ha tenganga.	And if any man lies with her and her menstrual impurity comes upon him, he shall be unclean seven days, and every bed on which he lies shall be unclean.
Wansati a nga tshuka a huma ngati masiku yo hlayanyana, kambe ku nga ri emasikwini ya yena ya n'hweti, naswona hambi ku ri emasikwini ya yena ya n'hweti, ngati yi nga tshuka yi ya emahlweni yi huma yi nga yimi. Loko swi va tano, wansati yoloye ú ta va a nga tenganga, ku fana ni le masikwini ya yena ya n'hweti.	If a woman has a discharge of blood for many days, not at the time of her menstrual impurity, or if she has a discharge beyond the time of her impurity, all the days of the discharge she shall continue in uncleanness. As in the days of her impurity, she shall be unclean.
Hikokwalaho, mubedo wun'wana ni wun'wana lowu wansati loyi a etlelaka eka wona, hambi xi ri xilo xihi ni xihi lexi a tshamaka eka xona, swi ta va swi nga ha tenganga, ku fana ni le masikwini ya yena ya n'hweti.	Every bed on which she lies, all the days of her discharge, shall be to her as the bed of her impurity. And everything on which she sits shall be unclean, as in the uncleanness of her menstrual impurity.
Naswona munhu un'wana ni un'wana loyi a khumbaka swilo leswi, ú fanele ku hlantswa swiambalo swa yena, a tlhela a hlamba ni miri; hambiswiritano, siku rero ú ta va a nga tengaga, dyambu ri ko ri pela.	And whoever touches these things shall be unclean, and shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the evening.
Endzhaku ka ku yima ka ngati, wansati loyi ú fanele ku hlaya masiku ya 7 ku sukela loko a horile, kutani hi kona a nga ta va a tengile.	But if she is cleansed of her discharge, she shall count for herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean.
Hi siku ra vu-8, ú fanele ku tilavela matuva mambirhi kumbe mavondlo mambirhi ya matuva, a ya na wona eka muprista, enyangweni ya Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka.	And on the eighth day she shall take two turtledoves or two pigeons and bring them to the priest, to the entrance of the tent of meeting.
Muprista ú ta fika a humesa matuva lawa, rin'we ri va ra mhamba yo susa swidyoho, lerin'wana ri va ra magandzelo lama hisiwaka. Hi ndlela leyi, muprista ú ta basisa wansati loyi emahlweni ka HOSI Xikwembu, hikwalaho ka ngati leyo ka yi nga tenganga leyi humeke.	And the priest shall use one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering. And the priest shall make atonement for her before the LORD for her unclean discharge.
Mi ta tsundzuxa Vaisraele hi mukhuva wolowo, leswaku va hambana ni swilo leswi swi nga tengangiki, kutani va nga ka va nga tivangeli rifu hi ku nyamisa Ntsonga wa mina lowo hlawuleka, lowu nga xikarhi ka vona.	Thus you shall keep the people of Israel separate from their uncleanness, lest they die in their uncleanness by defiling my tabernacle that is in their midst.
Hi yona milawu hi tlhelo ra lava va nga tengangiki, hikwalaho ka ndzhundzhwana kumbe hikwalaho ka ku huma mbewu yo veleka.	This is the law for him who has a discharge and for him who has an emission of semen, becoming unclean thereby
Milawu leyi yi katsa ni wansati loyi a nga tsakangiki emasikwini ya yena ya n'hweti, ni wanuna wa ndzhundzhwana, ni wansati wo huma ngati, ni wanuna la etlelaka ni wansati wo ka a nga tenganga.	also for her who is unwell with her menstrual impurity, that is, for anyone, male or female, who has a discharge, and for the man who lies with a woman who is unclean.
Endzhaku ka rifu ra vana vambirhi va Aroni, lava feke siku va tshineleke kusuhi na HOSI Xikwembu, xona xi vulavurile na Muxe	The LORD spoke to Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they drew near before the LORD and died
xi ku ka yena: Byela makwenu Aroni leswaku ku ni siku leri a nga nghenaka ha rona exivandleni lexo hlawuleka ngopfu lexi pfariweke hi xisirhelelo, laha ku nga ni Areka ni xitshamu xa yona xa ndzivalelo; a nga tshuki a nghena minkarhi yin'wana, hikuva a nga ta fa loko ndzi humelela epapeni, ehenhla ka xitshamu xa ndzivalelo.	and the LORD said to Moses, Tell Aaron your brother not to come at any time into the Holy Place inside the veil, before the mercy seat that is on the ark, so that he may not die. For I will appear in the cloud over the mercy seat.
Siku Aroni a nghenaka exivandleni lexo hlawuleka ngopfu, ú fanele ku ta ni xinkuzana xa mhamba yo susa swidyoho, ni nyimpfu ya khuna ya magandzelo lama hisiwaka.	But in this way Aaron shall come into the Holy Place: with a bull from the herd for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering.
Ú fanele ku ambala swiambalo swa ntsembyani swa vaprista, ku nga hembe, ni xiburukwana, ni vamba, ni xihuku; kambe ú fanele ku rhanga a hlamba miri a nga si swi ambala, hikuva swi hlawulekile.	He shall put on the holy linen coat and shall have the linen undergarment on his body, and he shall tie the linen sash around his waist, and wear the linen turban; these are the holy garments. He shall bathe his body in water and then put them on.
Naswona ntshungu wa Vaisraele wu fanele ku n'wi nyika swiphongho swimbirhi swa mhamba yo susa swidyoho, ni nyimpfu yin'we ya khuna ya magandzelo lama hisiwaka.	And he shall take from the congregation of the people of Israel two male goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering.
Aroni ú fanele ku rhanga a humesa xinkuzana, xi va mhamba yo susa swidyoho, a tibasisa ha xona, a basisa ni va ka vona.	Aaron shall offer the bull as a sin offering for himself and shall make atonement for himself and for his house.
Kutani ú ta teka swiphongho leswimbirhi, a ya yima na swona emahlweni ka mina HOSI, enyangweni ya Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka.	Then he shall take the two goats and set them before the LORD at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
Kutani Aroni ú ta hlawula xin'we xa swiphongho hi ku hoxa vuhlolotwana, leswaku xi humeseriwa mina HOSI, lexin'wana xi hlawuleriwa Azazele hi byona vuhlolotwana.	And Aaron shall cast lots over the two goats, one lot for the LORD and the other lot for Azazel.
Xiphongho lexi vuhlolotwana byi xi hlawuleke ku va xa mina HOSI, Aroni ú fanele ku xi tlhava, a endla ha xona mhamba yo susa swidyoho.	And Aaron shall present the goat on which the lot fell for the LORD and use it as a sin offering
Loko xi ri xiphongho lexi vuhlolotwana byi xi hlawuleke ku va xa Azazele, Aroni ú ta ta na xona emahlweni ka mina HOSI, xi ri karhi xi hanya, leswaku xi ta rhwexiwa swidyoho swa Vaisraele, xi khayimeriwa eka Azazele emananga.	but the goat on which the lot fell for Azazel shall be presented alive before the LORD to make atonement over it, that it may be sent away into the wilderness to Azazel.
Kutani Aroni ú fanele ku humesa xinkuzana, a xi tlhava xi va mhamba yo susa swidyoho, a tibasisa ha xona, a basisa ni va ka vona, hi ku xi tlhava.	Aaron shall present the bull as a sin offering for himself, and shall make atonement for himself and for his house. He shall kill the bull as a sin offering for himself.
Kutani a teka ximbitana xo oka ndzilo, a xi tata hi makala ya le alitarini leyi nga emahlweni ka mina HOSI, a nusa ni mapa ya murhi lowunene wa risuna, a nghena na swona exivandleni lexo hlawuleka lexi pfariweke hi xisirhelelo	And he shall take a censer full of coals of fire from the altar before the LORD, and two handfuls of sweet incense beaten small, and he shall bring it inside the veil

Kutani Aroni ú fanele ku peta ritiho ra yena kan'we engatini ya xinkuzana, a yi n'watseka ehenhla ka xitshamu xa ndzivalelo hi tlhelo ra le vuxeni, a tlhela a peta ritiho ka 7, a ri karhi a n'watseka ngati a yi kongomisa emahlweni ka Areka.	And he shall take some of the blood of the bull and sprinkle it with his finger on the front of the mercy seat on the east side, and in front of the mercy seat he shall sprinkle some of the blood with his finger seven times.
Kutani Aroni ú fanele ku tlhava xiphongho xa mhamba yo susa swidyoho swa Vaisraele, a nghena ni ngati ya xona exivandleni lexi pfariweke hi xisirhelelo, kutani a yi n'watseka ku fana ni ngati ya xinkuzana, a yi kongomisa ehenhla ka xitshamu xa ndzivalelo ni le mahlweni ka Areka.	Then he shall kill the goat of the sin offering that is for the people and bring its blood inside the veil and do with its blood as he did with the blood of the bull, sprinkling it over the mercy seat and in front of the mercy seat.
Hi ndlela leyi, ú ta basisa xivandla lexo hlawuleka ngopfu lexi nyamisiweke hi ku tiarisa ka Vaisraele ni swidyoho swa vona leswo tala; naswona ú ta basisa ni Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka hinkwawo, hikuva wu dzimiwile exikarhi ka vanhu lava nga tengangiki.	Thus he shall make atonement for the Holy Place, because of the uncleannesses of the people of Israel and because of their transgressions, all their sins. And so he shall do for the tent of meeting, which dwells with them in the midst of their uncleannesses.
Ku nga tshuki ku va na munhu un'wana la nghenaka eka Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka, ku sukela loko Aroni a nghenile exivandleni lexo hlawuleka ngopfu ku ya basisa swidyoho, ku kondza a huma. Loko a hetile ku tibasisa ni ku basisa ndyangu wa yena ni ntshungu hinkwawo wa Vaisraele	No one may be in the tent of meeting from the time he enters to make atonement in the Holy Place until he comes out and has made atonement for himself and for his house and for all the assembly of Israel.
ú fanele ku ya basisa alitari leyi nga mahlweni ka Ntsonga; ú ta teka ngatinyana ya xinkuzana ni ya xiphongho, a yi tota etimhondzweni ta alitari matlhelo hinkwawo.	Then he shall go out to the altar that is before the LORD and make atonement for it, and shall take some of the blood of the bull and some of the blood of the goat, and put it on the horns of the altar all around.
Kutani ú ta peta ritiho ra yena engatini ka 7, a ri karhi a yi n'watseka, a yi kongomisa etlhelweni ra alitari; ú ta basisa alitari ni ku yi hlawulekisa, hikuva Vaisraele va ta va va yi nyamisile.	And he shall sprinkle some of the blood on it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it and consecrate it from the uncleannesses of the people of Israel.
Loko Aroni a hetile ku basisa xivandla lexo hlawuleka ngopfu, ni Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka, ni alitari, ú fanele ku humesa xiphongho lexo hanya	And when he has made an end of atoning for the Holy Place and the tent of meeting and the altar, he shall present the live goat.
ú ta tlhandleka mavoko enhlokweni ya xiphongho xexo, a ri karhi a longoloxa mintirho hinkwayo leyo biha ya Vaisraele, ni ku tiarisa ka vona, ni swidyoho swa vona hinkwaswo; loko a swi vekile enhlokweni ya xiphongho, ú ta xi rhumela emananga, xi khayimiwa hi wanuna loyi a tilunghiseleke ntirho lowu.	And Aaron shall lay both his hands on the head of the live goat, and confess over it all the iniquities of the people of Israel, and all their transgressions, all their sins. And he shall put them on the head of the goat and send it away into the wilderness by the hand of a man who is in readiness.
Hi ndlela leyi, xiphongho xi ta rhwala mintirho hinkwayo leyo biha ya Vaisraele, xi yi yisa endhawini ya le kule; kutani wanuna loyi a khayimaka xiphongho, ú ta xi siya kwale mananga.	The goat shall bear all their iniquities on itself to a remote area, and he shall let the goat go free in the wilderness.
Kutani Aroni ú ta tlhela a nghena eka Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka, a hluvula swiambalo swa ntsembyani leswi a swi ambaleke loko a ya exivandleni lexo hlawuleka ngopfu, a swi siya kwalaho.	Then Aaron shall come into the tent of meeting and shall take off the linen garments that he put on when he went into the Holy Place and shall leave them there.
Kutani ú fanele ku hlamba miri endhawini leyi hlawulekeke, a ambala swiambalo swa yena swa vuprista, kutani a huma, a ya tibasisa ni ku basisa Vaisraele hi ku humesa magandzelo lama hisiwaka ya yena ni ya Vaisraele.	And he shall bathe his body in water in a holy place and put on his garments and come out and offer his burnt offering and the burnt offering of the people and make atonement for himself and for the people.
Loko ma ri mafurha ya mhamba yo susa swidyoho, Aroni ú fanele ku ma hisa alitarini.	And the fat of the sin offering he shall burn on the altar.
Wanuna loyi a khayimeleke xiphongho eka Azazele, ú fanele ku hlantswa swiambalo swa yena, a hlamba ni miri; hi kona a nga ta tlhelela emixaxeni.	And he who lets the goat go to Azazel shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water, and afterward he may come into the camp.
Naswona xinkuzana ni xiphongho xa mhamba yo susa swidyoho, swi nga swifuwo leswi ngati ya swona yi yisiweke exivandleni xo hlawuleka ku xi basisa, swi fanele ku rhwariwa swi yisiwa ehandle ka mixaxa, kutani nyama ya swona yi ta hisiwa kona, swin'we ni dzovo ni nswanyi.	And the bull for the sin offering and the goat for the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the Holy Place, shall be carried outside the camp. Their skin and their flesh and their dung shall be burned up with fire.
Munhu loyi a hisaka swilo leswi, ú fanele ku rhanga a hlantswa swiambalo ni ku hlamba miri, a nga si tlhelela emixaxeni.	And he who burns them shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water, and afterward he may come into the camp.
Nawu wun'wana lowu mi fanelaka ku wu hlayisa minkarhi hinkwayo, hi lowu: Hi siku ra vukhume ra n'hweti ya vu-7, mi fanele ku titsona swakudya, mi tshika mintirho hinkwayo, hambi n'wina Vaisraele kumbe lava luveleke exikarhi ka n'wina	And it shall be a statute to you forever that in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, you shall afflict yourselves and shall do no work, either the native or the stranger who sojourns among you.
hikuva, hi siku rero, mi ta basisiwa, mi hundzuka lava tengeke; swidyoho swa n'wina hinkwaswo swi ta susiwa emahlweni ka mina HOSI esikwini ra kona.	For on this day shall atonement be made for you to cleanse you. You shall be clean before the LORD from all your sins.
Siku leri, eka n'wina ri ta va ro wisa ra Savata, leri mi nga ta titsona swakudya ha rona. Nawu wolowo wu ta tirha hilaha ku nga heriki.	It is a Sabbath of solemn rest to you, and you shall afflict yourselves; it is a statute forever.
Muprista loyi a cheriweke mafurha enhlokweni siku a vekiwaka entirhweni wa tata wa yena, ú fanele ku humesa magandzelo yo susa swidyoho a ambarile swiambalo leswo hlawuleka swa ntsembyani	And the priest who is anointed and consecrated as priest in his father's place shall make atonement, wearing the holy linen garments.
a basisa xivandla lexo hlawuleka ngopfu, ni Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka, ni alitari, a basisa ni vaprista, ni ntshungu hinkwawo wa Vaisraele.	He shall make atonement for the holy sanctuary, and he shall make atonement for the tent of meeting and for the altar, and he shall make atonement for the priests and for all the people of the assembly.
Milawu leyi yi ta tirha hilaha ku nga heriki. Kan'we hi lembe, Vaisraele va ta basisiwa hikwalaho ka swidyoho swa vona hinkwaswo.
Kutani Muxe a endla hilaha HOSI Xikwembu xi n'wi leriseke hakona.	And this shall be a statute forever for you, that atonement may be made for the people of Israel once in the year because of all their sins. And Aaron did as the LORD commanded Moses.
HOSI Xikwembu xi byela Muxe	And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying
ku ya vulavula na Aroni, ni vana va yena, ni Vaisraele hinkwavo, a ku ka vona: Ku ni mhaka leyi HOSI Xikwembu xi mi lerisaka yona, yi nga leyi	Speak to Aaron and his sons and to all the people of Israel and say to them, This is the thing that the LORD has commanded.
X	If any one of the house of Israel kills an ox or a lamb or a goat in the camp, or kills it outside the camp
X	and does not bring it to the entrance of the tent of meeting to offer it as a gift to the LORD in front of the tabernacle of the LORD, bloodguilt shall be imputed to that man. He has shed blood, and that man shall be cut off from among his people.
Mhaka hileswaku Vaisraele va fanele ku teka swifuwo swa vona leswi va swi tlhavaka emakaya, va swi yisa eka muprista enyangweni ya Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka, va swi humesela HOSI Xikwembu kona, swi va magandzelo ya xinakulobye.	This is to the end that the people of Israel may bring their sacrifices that they sacrifice in the open field, that they may bring them to the LORD, to the priest at the entrance of the tent of meeting, and sacrifice them as sacrifices of peace offerings to the LORD.
Kutani muprista ú ta fika a teka ngati, a xuva hi yona alitari ya HOSI Xikwembu enyangweni ya Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka; a teka ni mafurha, a humesa ha wona magandzelo lama hisiwaka, lawa ku nun'hwela ka wona ku nga ta tsakisa HOSI Xikwembu.	And the priest shall throw the blood on the altar of the LORD at the entrance of the tent of meeting and burn the fat for a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
Hi ndlela leyi, Vaisraele a va nga ha endli vunghwavava hi ku tlhava swifuwo swa vona, va gandzela ha swona swikwembu swa vona swa swiphongho. Naswona va fanele ku hlayisa nawu lowu, vona ni vatukulu va vona, hilaha ku nga heriki.	So they shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices to goat demons, after whom they whore. This shall be a statute forever for them throughout their generations.
X	And you shall say to them, Any one of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who sojourn among them, who offers a burnt offering or sacrifice
X	and does not bring it to the entrance of the tent of meeting to offer it to the LORD, that man shall be cut off from his people.
Munhu un'wana ni un'wana, a nga va a ri Muisraele kumbe muluveri exikarhi ka Vaisraele, loko o tshuka a dya ngati, HOSI Xikwembu xi ta n'wi ba, xi n'wi hlongola, xi n'wi susa exikarhi ka va ka vona.	If any one of the house of Israel or of the strangers who sojourn among them eats any blood, I will set my face against that person who eats blood and will cut him off from among his people.
Mhaka hileswaku vutomi bya xivumbiwa byi le ngatini ya xona. Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi mi nyikile yona leswaku mi yi chela alitarini, mi tibasisa ha yona, hikuva ngati yi ni matimba yo basisa swidyoho hikwalaho ka vutomi lebyi byi nga ka yona.	For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it for you on the altar to make atonement for your souls, for it is the blood that makes atonement by the life.
Hikokwalaho, HOSI Xikwembu xi lerisile leswaku Vaisraele kumbe vanhu lava luveleke exikarhi ka vona, va nga tshuki va dya ngati.	Therefore I have said to the people of Israel, No person among you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger who sojourns among you eat blood.
Loko un'wana wa Vaisraele kumbe un'wana wa lava luveleke eka vona o tshuka a ya eku hloteni, kutani a dlaya xiharhi kumbe xinyanyana lexi a pfumeleriwaka ku dya nyama ya xona, ú fanele ku halata ngati ya xona, a yi seletela	Any one also of the people of Israel, or of the strangers who sojourn among them, who takes in hunting any beast or bird that may be eaten shall pour out its blood and cover it with earth.
hikuva vutomi bya xivumbiwa xin'wana ni xin'wana lexi hanyaka byi le ngatini ya xona; hikokwalaho HOSI Xikwembu xi lerisile Vaisraele leswaku va nga tshuki va dya ngati ya xivumbiwa xihi na xihi, hikuva ngati ya swivumbiwa hinkwaswo, hi byona vutomi bya swona. Munhu un'wana ni un'wana loyi a dyaka ngati, ú ta hlongoriwa, a susiwa exikarhi ka va ka vona.	For the life of every creature is its blood: its blood is its life. Therefore I have said to the people of Israel, You shall not eat the blood of any creature, for the life of every creature is its blood. Whoever eats it shall be cut off.
Munhu un'wana ni un'wana, a nga va Muisraele kumbe muluveri, loyi a dyaka nyama ya xifuwo lexi nga lo tifela hi xoxe, kumbe lexi dlayiweke hi swivandzana, ú fanele ku hlantswa swiambalo swa yena, a hlamba ni miri; hambiswiritano, siku rero ú ta va a nga tenganga, dyambu ri ko ri pela; kutani hi kona a nga ta va a tengile.	And every person who eats what dies of itself or what is torn by beasts, whether he is a native or a sojourner, shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the evening; then he shall be clean.
Kambe loko a nga hlantswi swiambalo, ni loko a nga hlambi miri, ú ta va a tivangele khombo.	But if he does not wash them or bathe his flesh, he shall bear his iniquity.
HOSI Xikwembu xi byela Muxe	And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying
ku ya tivisa Vaisraele marito ya xona lama nge: Hi mina HOSI Xikwembu xa n'wina.	Speak to the people of Israel and say to them, I am the LORD your God.
Mi nga tshuki mi landza mahanyelo ya tiko ra Egipta leri a mi tshama eka rona, naswona mi nga tshuki mi tekela mahanyelo ya tiko ra Kanana leri ndzi mi yisaka eka rona. Mi nga tshuki mi hanya hi milawu ya vona.	You shall not do as they do in the land of Egypt, where you lived, and you shall not do as they do in the land of Canaan, to which I am bringing you. You shall not walk in their statutes.
Mi fanele ku landza swiletelo swa mina, mi hlayisa milawu ya mina, mi hanya ha yona. Hi mina HOSI, Xikwembu xa n'wina.	You shall follow my rules and keep my statutes and walk in them. I am the LORD your God.
Ina, hlayisani milawu ya mina ni swiletelo swa mina, hikuva munhu loyi a endlaka sweswo, ú ta hanya. Hi mina HOSI!	You shall therefore keep my statutes and my rules; if a person does them, he shall live by them: I am the LORD.
Ku nga tshuki ku va ni un'we wa ka n'wina loyi a yaka a ya etlela ni wansati loyi swi yilaka leswaku a hlangana na yena. Hi mina HOSI!	None of you shall approach any one of his close relatives to uncover nakedness. I am the LORD.
U nga tshuki u khomisa tata wa wena tingana hi ku etlela ni mana wa wena; munhu loyi i mana wa wena, hikokwalaho u nga tshuki u etlela na yena.	You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father, which is the nakedness of your mother; she is your mother, you shall not uncover her nakedness.
Naswona, u nga tshuki u khomisa tata wa wena tingana hi ku etlela ni un'wana wa vasati va yena.	You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's wife; it is your father's nakedness.
U nga tshuki u etlela ni makwenu wa xisati; a nga va loyi mi mameke vele rin'we, kumbe loyi mi ngo hlangana eka tatana.	You shall not uncover the nakedness of your sister, your father's daughter or your mother's daughter, whether brought up in the family or in another home.
U nga tshuki u etlela ni ntukulu wa wena wa xisati; a nga va n'wana wa n'wana wa wena wa xinuna, kumbe n'wana wa n'wana wa wena wa xisati; hikuva sweswo i ku tikhomisa tingana.	You shall not uncover the nakedness of your son's daughter or of your daughter's daughter, for their nakedness is your own nakedness.
U nga tshuki u etlela ni makwenu wa xisati, loyi mi hambaneke hi vamanana, kumbe loyi mi hlanganaka eka tatana, hikuva munhu loyi i makwenu.	You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's wife's daughter, brought up in your father's family, since she is your sister.
U nga tshuki u etlela ni makwavo wa xisati wa tata wa wena hikuva i hahani wa wena.	You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's sister; she is your father's relative.
U nga tshuki u etlela ni makwavo wa xisati wa mana wa wena, hikuva na yena i mana wa wena.	You shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother's sister, for she is your mother's relative.
U nga tshuki u khomisa makwavo wa tata wa wena tingana hi ku etlela ni nsati wa yena, hikuva wansati loyi i mana wa wena.	You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's brother, that is, you shall not approach his wife; she is your aunt.
U nga tshuki u etlela ni nsati wa n'wana wa wena, hikuva i n'wingi wa wena, hikokwalaho u nga tshuki u etlela na yena.	You shall not uncover the nakedness of your daughter-in-law; she is your son's wife, you shall not uncover her nakedness.
U nga tshuki u khomisa makwenu tingana hi ku etlela ni nsati wa yena.	You shall not uncover the nakedness of your brother's wife; it is your brother's nakedness.
Loko u etlela ni wansati, u nga tshuki u ya etlela ni n'wana wa wansati loyi, naswona u nga tshuki u teka ntukulu wa xisati wa wansati loyi; a nga va n'wana wa yena wa xinuna kumbe n'wana wa n'wana wa yena wa xisati, hikuva vanhu lava i maxaka ya wansati loyi; ku etlela na vona i vuphukuphuku lebyikulu.	You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and of her daughter, and you shall not take her son's daughter or her daughter's daughter to uncover her nakedness; they are relatives; it is depravity.
U nga tshuki u teka namu wa wena leswaku a ta va nhlantswa, nsati wa wena a ha hanya.	And you shall not take a woman as a rival wife to her sister, uncovering her nakedness while her sister is still alive.
U nga tshuki u ya etlela ni wansati loyi a nga masikwini ya yena ya n'hweti, hikuva a nga tenganga.	You shall not approach a woman to uncover her nakedness while she is in her menstrual uncleanness.
U nga tshuki u tinyamisa hi ku ya etlela ni nsati wa muakelani.	And you shall not lie sexually with your neighbor's wife and so make yourself unclean with her.
U nga tshuki u nyiketa n'wana wa wena leswaku a hiseriwa Moloko xikwembu xa Vaamoni; sweswo ku ta va ku ri ku nyamisa vito ra mina HOSI, Xikwembu xa wena.	You shall not give any of your children to offer them to Molech, and so profane the name of your God: I am the LORD.
U nga tshuki u etlela ni wanuna wonge o va wansati; sweswo i manyala!	You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination.
U nga tshuki u tinyamisa hi ku etlela ni xifuwo xihi na xihi; hambi a ri wansati, a nga tshuki a ya etlela ni xifuwo; sweswo swa yila.	And you shall not lie with any animal and so make yourself unclean with it, neither shall any woman give herself to an animal to lie with it: it is perversion.
Mi nga tshuki mi tinyamisa hi ku endla xin'wana xa swilo leswi; hi swona leswi nyamisaka vamatiko lava ndzi va hlongoleke va suka emahlweni ka n'wina	Do not make yourselves unclean by any of these things, for by all these the nations I am driving out before you have become unclean
hikokwalaho, na rona tiko ra vona ri nyamisiwile, kutani ndzi bile vaaki va rona hikwalaho ka swidyoho leswi, va hlongoriwa va huma etikweni.	and the land became unclean, so that I punished its iniquity, and the land vomited out its inhabitants.
Kutani n'wina mi fanele ku hlayisa milawu ni swiletelo swa mina, mi nga tshuki mi endla ni xin'we xa swilo leswi swa manyala; a nga va Muisraele kumbe munhu loyi a luveleke exikarhi ka n'wina, a nga tshuki a swi endla.	But you shall keep my statutes and my rules and do none of these abominations, either the native or the stranger who sojourns among you
Vanhu lava a va akile laha tikweni leri mi nga si fika, a va endla swilo leswi hinkwaswo swa manyala, kutani va nyamisa tiko.	(for the people of the land, who were before you, did all of these abominations, so that the land became unclean)
Loko na n'wina mo endla sweswo, mi nyamisa tiko leri; mi ta hlongoriwa mi humesiwa laha tikweni, ku fana ni lava va hlongoriweke, va huma eka rona.	lest the land vomit you out when you make it unclean, as it vomited out the nation that was before you.
Un'wana ni un'wana loyi a nga ta endla manyala lawa, ú ta hlongoriwa a suka exikarhi ka va ka vona.	For everyone who does any of these abominations, the persons who do them shall be cut off from among their people.
Hikokwalaho, hlayisani leswi ndzi mi lerisaka swona, mi nga tshuki mi tekelela mikhuva ya manyala leyi a yi endliwa laha tikweni leri mi nga si fika; mi nga tshuki mi tinyamisa hi yona: Hi mina HOSI Xikwembu xa n'wina.	So keep my charge never to practice any of these abominable customs that were practiced before you, and never to make yourselves unclean by them: I am the LORD your God.
HOSI Xikwembu xi byele Muxe	And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying
ku ya tivisa ntshungu hinkwawo wa Vaisraele marito ya xona lama nge: Hlawulekani, hikuva ndzi hlawulekile mina HOSI, Xikwembu xa n'wina.	Speak to all the congregation of the people of Israel and say to them, You shall be holy, for I the LORD your God am holy.
Un'wana ni un'wana wa n'wina ú fanele ku va ni xichavo eka mana wa yena ni ka tata wa yena, naswona a hlayisa masiku ya mina ya Savata: Hi mina HOSI, Xikwembu xa n'wina.	Every one of you shall revere his mother and his father, and you shall keep my Sabbaths: I am the LORD your God.
Mi nga tshuki mi gandzela swikwembu swa hava, naswona mi nga tshuki mi n'okisa swilo, mi tivumbela swifaniso swa swikwembu: Hi mina HOSI, Xikwembu xa n'wina.	Do not turn to idols or make for yourselves any gods of cast metal: I am the LORD your God.
Loko mi ndzi tlhavela xifuwo xa magandzelo ya xinakulobye, xi tlhaveni hi ndlela leyi yi nga ta endla leswaku ndzi mi tsakela.	When you offer a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD, you shall offer it so that you may be accepted.
Nyama ya kona yi fanele ku dyiwa siku xi tlhaviwaka, kumbe siku leri tlhandlamaka. Kambe nyama leyi nga ta va ya ha sele hi siku ra vunharhu, yona yi fanele ku hisiwa.	It shall be eaten the same day you offer it or on the day after, and anything left over until the third day shall be burned up with fire.
Nyama leyi saleke a yi dyiwi hi siku ra vunharhu, sweswo swa yila, a ndzi swi nkhensi mina.	If it is eaten at all on the third day, it is tainted; it will not be accepted
Loyi a yi dyaka, ú ta tivangela nandzu, hikuva ú ta va a tlangile hi xilo lexi a xi hlawuriwile ku va xa mina; kutani ú fanele ku hlongoriwa a suka exikarhi ka va ka vona.	and everyone who eats it shall bear his iniquity, because he has profaned what is holy to the LORD, and that person shall be cut off from his people.
Loko mi tshovela swa le masin'wini ya n'wina, mi nga tshoveli mi ya fika emakumu ka nsimu, naswona loko mi hetile ku tshovela, mi nga tlheli mi ya khwaja.	When you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not reap your field right up to its edge, neither shall you gather the gleanings after your harvest.
Ni loko mi tshovela vhinya ya n'wina, mi nga khayeleli mihandzu hinkwayo mi heta, naswona mi nga rholeli leyi nga wela hansi; siyani yin'wana mihandzu, mi yi siyela swisiwana ni valuveri: Hi mina HOSI, Xikwembu xa n'wina.	And you shall not strip your vineyard bare, neither shall you gather the fallen grapes of your vineyard. You shall leave them for the poor and for the sojourner: I am the LORD your God.
Mi nga tshuki mi yiva, mi nga kanganyisani, naswona mi nga hembelani.	You shall not steal; you shall not deal falsely; you shall not lie to one another.
Mi nga tiyisi mavunwa hi ku hlambanya hi vito ra mina Xikwembu xa n'wina, hikuva sweswo i ku tlanga hi vito leri: Hi mina HOSI.	You shall not swear by my name falsely, and so profane the name of your God: I am the LORD.
Mi nga tshuki mi xanisa munhukuloni kumbe ku n'wi tekela swilo swa yena; naswona loko mi thorile munhu, mi nga tshuki mi tshama ni muholo wa yena ku fikela siku leri tlhandlamaka.	You shall not oppress your neighbor or rob him. The wages of a hired worker shall not remain with you all night until the morning.
Mi nga tshuki mi rhuketela munhu wo-fe-tindleve, naswona mi nga veki nchumu emahlweni ka lowo-fe-mahlo, lexi xi nga n'wi phijaka. Chavani mina Xikwembu xa n'wina: Hi mina HOSI.	You shall not curse the deaf or put a stumbling block before the blind, but you shall fear your God: I am the LORD.
Loko mi ri ehubyeni, mi nga tsemi timhaka hi ndlela leyi nga lulamangiki. Mi nga yi hi nghohe, mi yima na un'wana ehubyeni, a nga va xisiwana kumbe xifumi.	You shall do no injustice in court. You shall not be partial to the poor or defer to the great, but in righteousness shall you judge your neighbor.
Mi nga fambi mi vulavula swo biha hi varikwenu; naswona mi nga humesi vumbhoni byo hemba lebyi byi nga dlayisaka warikwenu: Hi mina HOSI.	You shall not go around as a slanderer among your people, and you shall not stand up against the life of your neighbor: I am the LORD.
Timbilu ta n'wina ti nga tshuki ti tala rivengo hi mhaka ya makwenu, kambe yanani mi ya vulavula na yena, mi ta ka mi nga tivangeli xidyoho.	You shall not hate your brother in your heart, but you shall reason frankly with your neighbor, lest you incur sin because of him.
Mi nga rihiseli, naswona mi nga vi na xikhomela; un'wana ni un'wana a a rhandze munhukulobye, kukota loko a tirhandza: Hi mina HOSI.	You shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against the sons of your own people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself: I am the LORD.
Mi fanele ku hlayisa milawu ya mina leyi: Mi nga tshuki mi tshika swifuwo swa n'wina swa tinxaka to hambana swi khandziyana; mi nga tshuki mi byala tinxaka timbirhi ta swimilana ensin'wini yin'we; naswona mi nga tshuki mi ambala swiambalo leswi lukiweke hi tinxaka timbirhi ta tingoti.	You shall keep my statutes. You shall not let your cattle breed with a different kind. You shall not sow your field with two kinds of seed, nor shall you wear a garment of cloth made of two kinds of material.

If a man lies sexually with a woman who is a slave, assigned to another man and not yet ransomed or given her freedom, a distinction shall be made. They shall not be put to death, because she was not free
Wanuna ú fanele ku ndzi humesela magandzelo yo riha milandzu; ú ta tilavela nyimpfu ya khuna, a ta na yona enyangweni ya Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka, a ta humesa ha yona magandzelo yo riha milandzu.	but he shall bring his compensation to the LORD, to the entrance of the tent of meeting, a ram for a guilt offering.
Muprista ú ta fika a teka khuna leri ra magandzelo yo riha milandzu, a basisa ha rona swidyoho swa wanuna loyi emahlweni ka mina HOSI, kutani ú ta rivaleriwa swona.	And the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering before the LORD for his sin that he has committed, and he shall be forgiven for the sin that he has committed.
Loko mi fika etikweni ra Kanana, kutani mi byala mirhi ya tinxaka-xaka ya mihandzu, tivani leswaku a mi pfumeleriwi ku dya mihandzu ya kona, ku kondza ku hela malembe manharhu; emalembeni lawa, mi nga tshuki mi yi dya.	When you come into the land and plant any kind of tree for food, then you shall regard its fruit as forbidden. Three years it shall be forbidden to you; it must not be eaten.
Hi lembe ra vumune, mihandzu hinkwayo yi ta va yi hlawulekile, mi ta ndzi dzunisa hi ku ndzi humesela yona mina HOSI.	And in the fourth year all its fruit shall be holy, an offering of praise to the LORD.
Hi lembe ra vuntlhanu, mi nga sungula ku dya mihandzu ya mirhi ya n'wina, leswaku yi ta hamba yi tswala swinene: Hi mina HOSI, Xikwembu xa n'wina.	But in the fifth year you may eat of its fruit, to increase its yield for you: I am the LORD your God.
Mi nga tshuki mi dya nyama ni ngati ya kona. Mi nga tshuki mi hlahluva kumbe ku tirhisa swa vungoma.	You shall not eat any flesh with the blood in it. You shall not interpret omens or tell fortunes.

Do not profane your daughter by making her a prostitute, lest the land fall into prostitution and the land become full of depravity.
Mi fanele ku hlayisa masiku ya mina ya Savata, mi xixima ni xivandla xa mina lexo hlawuleka: Hi mina HOSI.	You shall keep my Sabbaths and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD.
Mi nga tshuki mi ya eka lava nga ni swikwembu kumbe eka swingomantanda, mi nga tshuki mi tinyamisa hi ku tirhisana na vanhu vo tano: Hi mina HOSI, Xikwembu xa n'wina.	Do not turn to mediums or necromancers; do not seek them out, and so make yourselves unclean by them: I am the LORD your God.

HOSI Xikwembu xi byela Muxe	The LORD spoke to Moses, saying
ku ya tivisa Vaisraele marito ya xona lama nge: Loko un'wana wa Vaisraele kumbe un'wana wa lava luveleke exikarhi ka Vaisraele, a yisa n'wana wa yena eka Moloko xikwembu xa Vaamoni, ú fanele ku dlayiwa hi ntshungu hinkwawo, va n'wi khandla hi maribye, a fa.	Say to the people of Israel, Any one of the people of Israel or of the strangers who sojourn in Israel who gives any of his children to Molech shall surely be put to death. The people of the land shall stone him with stones.
Munhu loyi a yisaka n'wana wa yena eka Moloko, ú nyamisa xivandla xa mina lexo hlawuleka, a onha ni vito ra mina; hikokwalaho ndzi ta n'wi ba, ndzi n'wi hlongola a suka exikarhi ka va ka vona.	I myself will set my face against that man and will cut him off from among his people, because he has given one of his children to Molech, to make my sanctuary unclean and to profane my holy name.
Kambe loko Vaisraele va tshika munhu loyi a yisaka n'wana wa yena eka Moloko, va endla wonge a va n'wi voni, kutani va nga n'wi dlayi	And if the people of the land do at all close their eyes to that man when he gives one of his children to Molech, and do not put him to death
mina hi xiviri ndzi ta ba munhu yoloyi ndzi ba ni ndyangu wa yena, swin'we ni hinkwavo lava endlaka na yena vunghwavava hi ku tirhela Moloko; ndzi ta va hlongola va suka exikarhi ka va ka vona.	then I will set my face against that man and against his clan and will cut them off from among their people, him and all who follow him in whoring after Molech.
Munhu loyi a yaka eka lava nga ni swikwembu ni ka swingomantanda, ndzi ta n'wi ba, ndzi n'wi hlongola a suka exikarhi ka va ka vona.	If a person turns to mediums and necromancers, whoring after them, I will set my face against that person and will cut him off from among his people.
Hikokwalaho, hambanani ni mikhuva yo tano, mi va lava hlawulekeke: Hi mina HOSI, Xikwembu xa n'wina.	Consecrate yourselves, therefore, and be holy, for I am the LORD your God.
Mi fanele ku hlayisa milawu ya mina, mi hanya ha yona: Hi mina HOSI, Xikwembu lexi xi mi hlawulekisaka.	Keep my statutes and do them; I am the LORD who sanctifies you.
Loko munhu a rhuketela tata wa yena kumbe mana wa yena, ú fanele ku dlayiwa. Ú ta va a lo tivangela rifu, hikuva ú rhuketerile vatswari.	For anyone who curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death; he has cursed his father or his mother; his blood is upon him.
Loko wanuna a endla vuoswi ni nsati wa munhukulobye, vaoswi lava va fanele ku dlayiwa hi vumbirhi bya vona.	If a man commits adultery with the wife of his neighbor, both the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.
Munhu loyi a khomisaka tata wa yena tingana hi ku etlela ni un'wana wa vasati va tata wa yena, ú fanele ku dlayiwa, swin'we ni wansati wa kona; rifu ro tano, va ta va va lo tilavela.	If a man lies with his father's wife, he has uncovered his father's nakedness; both of them shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them.
Munhu loyi a etlelaka ni nsati wa n'wana wa yena, ú fanele ku dlayiwa swin'we ni n'wingi loyi wa yena; rifu ra kona va ta va va lo tivangela, hikuva leswi va swi endleke, swa yila swinene.	If a man lies with his daughter-in-law, both of them shall surely be put to death; they have committed perversion; their blood is upon them.
Wanuna loyi a etlelaka ni wanuna-kulobye, wonge o va wansati, ú fanele ku dlayiwa swin'we ni wanuna wa kona; rifu ro tano va ta va va lo tivangela, hikuva va endlile manyala hi vumbirhi bya vona.	If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them.
Loko wanuna a teka wansati, a tlhela a ya teka ni mana wa nsati wa yena, ú endla mhaka yo homboloka; hikokwalaho, yena ni vavasati lava va fanele ku hisiwa hinkwavo, leswaku ku nga ha vi na swo homboloka exikarhi ka n'wina.	If a man takes a woman and her mother also, it is depravity; he and they shall be burned with fire, that there may be no depravity among you.
Wanuna loyi a etlelaka ni xifuwo, ú fanele ku dlayiwa; na xona xifuwo xa kona, mi fanele ku xi dlaya.	If a man lies with an animal, he shall surely be put to death, and you shall kill the animal.
Wansati loyi a yaka a ya etlela ni xifuwo, ú fanele ku dlayiwa ni xifuwo xa kona. Rifu ro tano, wansati loyi ú ta va a lo tilavela, swin'we ni xifuwo xa kona.	If a woman approaches any animal and lies with it, you shall kill the woman and the animal; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them.
Ku nga tshuka ku va ni wanuna loyi a tekaka makwavo wa yena, loyi va mameke vele rin'we, kumbe loyi va ngo hlangana eka tatana, kutani vanhu lava va etlela swin'we. Mhaka leyi yi nyumisa ngopfu; vanhu volavo ha vambirhi ka vona va fanele ku hlongoriwa, va ka vona va langutile. Wanuna ú ta va a tivangele nandzu hi ku etlela ni makwavo wa yena.	If a man takes his sister, a daughter of his father or a daughter of his mother, and sees her nakedness, and she sees his nakedness, it is a disgrace, and they shall be cut off in the sight of the children of their people. He has uncovered his sister's nakedness, and he shall bear his iniquity.
Loko wanuna a ya etlela ni wansati loyi a nga masikwini ya yena ya n'hweti, ú fanele ku hlongoriwa swin'we ni wansati loyi, va susiwa exikarhi ka va ka vona, hikuva va ta va va humesele erivaleni xihlovo xa ngati ya wansati loyi.	If a man lies with a woman during her menstrual period and uncovers her nakedness, he has made naked her fountain, and she has uncovered the fountain of her blood. Both of them shall be cut off from among their people.
Ku nga vi na munhu loyi a etlelaka ni makwavo wa mana wa yena, hikuva na yena i mana wa yena; naswona ku nga vi na loyi a etlelaka ni makwavo wa xisati wa tata wa yena, hikuva i hahani wa yena; lava endlaka sweswo va ta va va tivangele nandzu.	You shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother's sister or of your father's sister, for that is to make naked one's relative; they shall bear their iniquity.
Munhu loyi a etlelaka ni nsati wa makwa wa tata wa yena, ú khomisa makwavo wa tata wa yena tingana; kutani lava etleleke swin'we va ta va va tivangele khombo: va ta fa va nga ri na vana.	If a man lies with his uncle's wife, he has uncovered his uncle's nakedness; they shall bear their sin; they shall die childless.
Loko munhu a teka nsati wa makwavo, ú khomisa makwavo tingana hi mhaka leyi ya manyala; yena ni wansati loyi va nga ka va nga kumi vana.	If a man takes his brother's wife, it is impurity. He has uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall be childless.
Mi fanele ku hlayisa milawu ya mina hinkwayo ni swiletelo swa mina hinkwaswo; loko mo endla sweswo, a mi nga hlongoriwi mi humesiwa etikweni leri ndzi lavaka ku mi nghenisa eka rona leswaku mi tshama eka rona.	You shall therefore keep all my statutes and all my rules and do them, that the land where I am bringing you to live may not vomit you out.
Mi nga tshuki mi landza mikhuva ya vamatiko lava ndzi nga ta va hlongola va suka emahlweni ka n'wina; vanhu lava va ndzi dyisa mbitsi hi ku endla swilo leswi hinkwaswo swa manyala.	And you shall not walk in the customs of the nation that I am driving out before you, for they did all these things, and therefore I detested them.
Hikokwalaho ndzi mi tshembisile ndzi ku: ‘Tiko ra vona ro khuluka ntswamba ni vulombe, ri ta va ndzhaka ya n'wina, ndzi ta mi nyika rona ri va ra n'wina.’ Hi mina HOSI, Xikwembu xa n'wina lexi xi mi hlawuleke exikarhi ka man'wana matiko.	But I have said to you, 'You shall inherit their land, and I will give it to you to possess, a land flowing with milk and honey.' I am the LORD your God, who has separated you from the peoples.
Hikokwalaho, mi fanele ku tiva ku hambana exikarhi ka swiharhi leswi tengeke ni leswi nga tengangiki, kumbe exikarhi ka tinyanyana leti tengeke ni leti nga tengangiki. Mi nga tshuki mi tithyakisa hi swiharhi kumbe tinyanyana kumbe swihadyana hinkwaswo leswi tateke misava, leswi ndzi mi byeleke leswaku a swi tenganga.	You shall therefore separate the clean beast from the unclean, and the unclean bird from the clean. You shall not make yourselves detestable by beast or by bird or by anything with which the ground crawls, which I have set apart for you to hold unclean.
Hlawulekani, mi tirhela mina ntsena, hikuva ndzi hlawulekile mina HOSI; ndzi mi hlawurile exikarhi ka vanhu va matiko man'wana leswaku mi va va mina.	You shall be holy to me, for I the LORD am holy and have separated you from the peoples, that you should be mine.
Wanuna kumbe wansati loyi a nga ni swikwembu kumbe loyi a nga xingomantanda, ú fanele ku dlayiwa, a khandliwa hi maribye, a fa; rifu rero, ú ta va a lo tilavela rona.	A man or a woman who is a medium or a necromancer shall surely be put to death. They shall be stoned with stones; their blood shall be upon them.
HOSI Xikwembu xi byela Muxe ku ya tivisa vaprista, vona vana va Aroni, marito ya xona lama nge: Muprista a nga tshuki a tinyamisa hi ku ya eminkosini ya maxaka ya yena	And the LORD said to Moses, Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron, and say to them, No one shall make himself unclean for the dead among his people

kumbe makwavo wa yena wa xisati loyi a nga si tekiwaka, loyi a ha tshamaka ekaya; loko ku fa yoloyi, muprista a nga chavi ku n'wi lahla.	or his virgin sister (who is near to him because she has had no husband; for her he may make himself unclean).
Kambe a nga tshuki a ya enkosini wa makwavo loyi a tekiweke, hikuva sweswo swi ta n'wi nyamisa.	He shall not make himself unclean as a husband among his people and so profane himself.
Enkarhini wa nkosi, vaprista va nga tshuki va byewula misisi kumbe ku tsemeta malebvu lomu matlhelo, naswona va nga tshuki va tixekelela-xekelela.	They shall not make bald patches on their heads, nor shave off the edges of their beards, nor make any cuts on their body.
Va fanele ku hlawuleka, va tirhela mina Xikwembu xa vona, va nga nyamisi vito ra mina, hikuva hi vona lava va ndzi humeselaka magandzelo, swi nga swakudya swa mina HOSI Xikwembu xa vona; hikokwalaho va fanele ku va lava hlawulekeke.	They shall be holy to their God and not profane the name of their God. For they offer the LORD's food offerings, the bread of their God; therefore they shall be holy.
Loko va teka, va nga tshuki va ya lava nghwavava, kumbe loyi a nga tshama a tivana ni wanuna, kumbe wansati loyi a tshikaneke ni nuna, hikuva muprista ú hlawuleriwe ku tirhela mina Xikwembu xa yena.	They shall not marry a prostitute or a woman who has been defiled, neither shall they marry a woman divorced from her husband, for the priest is holy to his God.
Vaisraele va fanele ku xixima vaprista, hikuva hi vona lava humesaka magandzelo, swi nga swakudya swa mina Xikwembu xa n'wina; a va tsundzuke leswaku vaprista va hlawulekile, hikuva mina HOSI Xikwembu lexi xi mi hlawulekisaka, ndzi hlawulekile.	You shall sanctify him, for he offers the bread of your God. He shall be holy to you, for I, the LORD, who sanctify you, am holy.
N'wana wa xisati wa muprista loyi a tinyamisaka hi ku endla vunghwavava, ú nyamisa ni tata wa yena; hikokwalaho ú fanele ku hisiwa, a fa.	And the daughter of any priest, if she profanes herself by whoring, profanes her father; she shall be burned with fire.
Muprista Lonkulu, hi yena ntsena loyi a cheriweke mafurha enhlokweni exikarhi ka vaprista, naswona ú ambarile swiambalo swa vuprista leswo hlawuleka; hikokwalaho a nga tshuki a tshika misisi ya yena yi hangalaka kumbe a handzula swiambalo swa yena loko ku ri ni nkosi.	The priest who is chief among his brothers, on whose head the anointing oil is poured and who has been consecrated to wear the garments, shall not let the hair of his head hang loose nor tear his clothes.
Naswona a nga tshuki a nghena laha ku nga ni ntsumbu, hambiloko ku file tata wa yena kumbe mana wa yena, hikuva a nga ta tinyamisa.	He shall not go in to any dead bodies nor make himself unclean, even for his father or for his mother.
Muprista Lonkulu ú cheriwile mafurha layo hlawuleka ya mina Xikwembu xa yena, hikokwalaho a nga tshuki a nyamisa xivandla xa mina lexo hlawuleka hi ku huma a ya enkosini: Hi mina HOSI.	He shall not go out of the sanctuary, lest he profane the sanctuary of his God, for the consecration of the anointing oil of his God is on him: I am the LORD.
Loko a teka nsati, ú fanele ku lava wansati loyi a nga si tivanaka ni wanuna.	And he shall take a wife in her virginity.
A nga tshuki a teka noni, kumbe wansati loyi a tshikaneke ni nuna, kumbe loyi a tshamaka a tivana ni wanuna, kumbe nghwavava. Ú fanele ku teka wansati wa rixaka ra ka vona loyi a nga si tshamaka a tivana ni wanuna.	A widow, or a divorced woman, or a woman who has been defiled, or a prostitute, these he shall not marry. But he shall take as his wife a virgin of his own people
Loko a nga endlisi sweswo, vana lava a nga ta va kuma, va ta va va nga tenganga: Hi mina HOSI, Xikwembu lexi xi n'wi hlawulekisaka.	that he may not profane his offspring among his people, for I am the LORD who sanctifies him.
HOSI Xikwembu xi byela Muxe	And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying
ku ya vulavula na Aroni, a n'wi tivisa marito ya xona lama nge: Eminkarhini hinkwayo leyi taka, ku nga tshuki ku va na un'wana wa vatukulu va wena loyi a taka a nga hetisekanga, a ta ndzi humesela magandzelo mina HOSI Xikwembu xa yena.	Speak to Aaron, saying, None of your offspring throughout their generations who has a blemish may approach to offer the bread of his God.
Munhu loyi a nga hetisekangiki, a nga tshuki a tshinela kusuhi ni alitari: A nga va lowo-fe-mahlo, kumbe xilema, kumbe loyi a vavisekeke exikandzeni, kumbe loyi mavoko kumbe milenge swi nga ringananiki	For no one who has a blemish shall draw near, a man blind or lame, or one who has a mutilated face or a limb too long
kumbe loyi a vavisekeke nenge kumbe voko	or a man who has an injured foot or an injured hand

Ku nga tshuki ku va na un'we exikarhi ka vatukulu va wena Aroni loyi a taka a ta ndzi humesela magandzelo, loko a nga hetisekanga. Loyi a nga hetisekangiki, a nga tshuki a tshinela a ndzi humesela magandzelo mina Xikwembu xa yena.	No man of the offspring of Aaron the priest who has a blemish shall come near to offer the LORD's food offerings; since he has a blemish, he shall not come near to offer the bread of his God.
Hambiswiritano, wa pfumeleriwa ku dya swakudya swa magandzelo lama humeseriweke mina exivandleni lexo hlawuleka ngopfu, a nga dya ni tinyiko leto hlawuleka.	He may eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy and of the holy things
Kambe a nga tshuki a tshinela kusuhi ni xisirhelelo lexi pfalaka xivandla lexo hlawuleka ngopfu; ni le alitarini a nga tshineli, hikuva leswi a nga hetisekangiki, a nga nyamisa leswi nga ndzeni ka Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka: Hi mina HOSI Xikwembu lexi hlawulekisaka vaprista.	but he shall not go through the veil or approach the altar, because he has a blemish, that he may not profane my sanctuaries, for I am the LORD who sanctifies them.
Kutani Muxe a fikisa marito lawa eka Aroni, ni vana va Aroni, ni Vaisraele hinkwavo.	So Moses spoke to Aaron and to his sons and to all the people of Israel.
HOSI Xikwembu xi vulavula na Muxe, xi ku	And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying
Byela Aroni ni vana va yena leswaku va nga tshuki va nyamisa vito ra mina lero hlawuleka; va fanele ku tivonela swinene loko va ndzi tisela tinyiko leto hlawuleka leti humesiweke hi Vaisraele: Hi mina HOSI.	Speak to Aaron and his sons so that they abstain from the holy things of the people of Israel, which they dedicate to me, so that they do not profane my holy name: I am the LORD.
Va tivise leswaku, eminkarhini hinkwayo leyi taka, loko un'wana wa vatukulu va vona loyi a nga tengangiki a tshuka a tshinela kusuhi ni tinyiko leto hlawuleka leti Vaisraele va ndzi humeselaka tona, ú fanele ku hlongoriwa, a nga ha ti emahlweni ka mina: Hi mina HOSI.	Say to them, 'If any one of all your offspring throughout your generations approaches the holy things that the people of Israel dedicate to the LORD, while he has an uncleanness, that person shall be cut off from my presence: I am the LORD.
Munhu un'wana ni un'wana wa ka Aroni loyi a nga ni vuvabyi bya nhlonge kumbe ndzhundzhwana, a nga tshuki a dya tinyiko leto hlawuleka, ku kondza a va la tengeke.

Loko dyambu ri perile, ú ta va a tengile, kutani ú ta kota ku dya tinyiko leto hlawuleka, hikuva hi swona swakudya swa yena.	When the sun goes down he shall be clean, and afterward he may eat of the holy things, because they are his food.
Muprista a nga tshuki a tinyamisa hi ku dya nyama ya xifuwo lexi nga lo tifela, kumbe lexi dlayiweke hi swivandzana: Hi mina HOSI.	He shall not eat what dies of itself or is torn by beasts, and so make himself unclean by it: I am the LORD.'

They shall therefore keep my charge, lest they bear sin for it and die thereby when they profane it: I am the LORD who sanctifies them.
Munhu loyi a nga riki muprista a nga tshuki a dya tinyiko leto hlawuleka, a nga va muyeni wa muprista, kumbe loyi muprista a n'wi tholeke.	A lay person shall not eat of a holy thing; no foreign guest of the priest or hired worker shall eat of a holy thing
Kambe munhu wa hlonga loyi muprista a n'wi xaveke hi mali, kumbe loyi a nga velekiwa emutini wa yena, wa pfumeleriwa ku dya swakudya swa vaprista.	but if a priest buys a slave as his property for money, the slave may eat of it, and anyone born in his house may eat of his food.
N'wana wa muprista loyi a tekiweke hi munhu ntsena, a nga tshuki a dya tinyiko leto hlawuleka leti humeseriweke Xikwembu.	If a priest's daughter marries a layman, she shall not eat of the contribution of the holy things.
Kambe loko n'wana wa xisati wa muprista loyi a feriweke hi nuna, kumbe loyi a tshikaneke ni nuna a nga si va na n'wana, kutani a vuya ekaya a ta tshama kona kukota loko a ha ri nhwana, yena a nga dya swakudya swa tata wa yena. Munhu wa le handle yena a nga tshuki a dya swakudya leswi.	But if a priest's daughter is widowed or divorced and has no child and returns to her father's house, as in her youth, she may eat of her father's food; yet no lay person shall eat of it.

And if anyone eats of a holy thing unintentionally, he shall add the fifth of its value to it and give the holy thing to the priest.
Vaprista va nga tshuki va nyamisa swa tinyiko leto hlawuleka leti Vaisraele va ndzi humeselaka tona	They shall not profane the holy things of the people of Israel, which they contribute to the LORD
hi ku pfumelela munhu ntsena ku dya tinyiko ta kona; hikuva munhu wo tano ú ta va a tivangele nandzu lowu a nga ta fanela ku wu riha: Hi mina HOSI, Xikwembu lexi hlawulekisaka tinyiko leti.	and so cause them to bear iniquity and guilt, by eating their holy things: for I am the LORD who sanctifies them.
HOSI Xikwembu xi byela Muxe	And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying
ku ya tivisa Aroni ni vana va yena ni Vaisraele hinkwavo marito ya xona lama nge: Muisraele un'wana ni un'wana, kumbe munhu loyi a luveleke exikarhi ka Vaisraele, loko a lava ku ndzi humesela magandzelo lama hiseriwaka mina HOSI, lawa a tiboheke hi ku hlambanya leswaku ú ta ma humesa, kumbe lawa a ngo ma humesa hi ku titwa	Speak to Aaron and his sons and all the people of Israel and say to them, When any one of the house of Israel or of the sojourners in Israel presents a burnt offering as his offering, for any of their vows or freewill offerings that they offer to the LORD
ú fanele ku tlhava xifuwo xa xinuna lexi nga solekiki, yi nga nkuzi kumbe khuna kumbe xiphongho. Loko a endlisa sweswo, hi kona a nga ta tsakeriwa hi mina HOSI.	if it is to be accepted for you it shall be a male without blemish, of the bulls or the sheep or the goats.
Mi nga tshuki mi humesa swifuwo leswi swi nga hetisekangiki; leswo tano mina HOSI Xikwembu a ndzi nga swi amukeri, loko mo swi humesa.	You shall not offer anything that has a blemish, for it will not be acceptable for you.
Un'wana ni un'wana loyi a ndzi humeselaka magandzelo ya xinakulobye, ma nga va lawa a tiboheke a hlambanya ku ma humesa, kumbe lawa a ngo ma humesa hi ku titwa, ú fanele ku pambula xifuwo lexinene lexi nga solekiki eka swifuwo swa yena leswikulu kumbe leswitsongo; hi kona ndzi nga ta n'wi tsakela.	And when anyone offers a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD to fulfill a vow or as a freewill offering from the herd or from the flock, to be accepted it must be perfect; there shall be no blemish in it.
Swifuwo leswi feke mahlo, kumbe leswi lamaleke, kumbe leswi nga ni swivati, kumbe ndzhundzhwana, kumbe gwembe, kumbe swilondza, mi nga tshuki mi ndzi humesela swona mina HOSI, kumbe ku ndzi hisela swona alitarini.	Animals blind or disabled or mutilated or having a discharge or an itch or scabs you shall not offer to the LORD or give them to the LORD as a food offering on the altar.
Loko mi humesa magandzelo lawa mi ngo ma humesa hi ku titwa, mi nga tlhava hambi yi ri nkuzi kumbe nyimpfu leyi mavoko kumbe milenge ya yona yi nga ringananiki; kambe xifuwo xo tano a xi nkhenseki eka magandzelo lawa mi tiboheke hi ku hlambanya leswaku mi ta ma humesa.	You may present a bull or a lamb that has a part too long or too short for a freewill offering, but for a vow offering it cannot be accepted.
Mi nga tshuki mi ndzi humesela magandzelo hi xifuwo lexi hala mahlweni ka xona ku pfimbeke, kumbe ku tsheniweke, kumbe ku vavisekeke, kumbe ku tsemiweke kunene; etikweni ra n'wina a swi pfumeleriwi ku humesa magandzelo hi xifuwo xo tano.	Any animal that has its testicles bruised or crushed or torn or cut you shall not offer to the LORD; you shall not do it within your land
Naswona mi nga tshuki mi ndzi humesela swakudya hi swifuwo swo tano, leswi mi swi kumeke eka vanhu lava va nga riki Vaisraele. Swifuwo leswi a swi hetisekanga, swi tekiwa swi ri ni swivati, kutani a swi nga amukeriwi loko mo humesa ha swona magandzelo.	neither shall you offer as the bread of your God any such animals gotten from a foreigner. Since there is a blemish in them, because of their mutilation, they will not be accepted for you.
HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe	And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying
Xifuwo lexi xa ha ku velekiwaka, yi nga va nkuzi kumbe khuna kumbe xiphongho, xi fanele ku tshama ni mana wa xona ku ringana masiku ya 7. Ku sukela siku ra vu-8, xifuwo xexo xa amukeleka loko mi ndzi humesela magandzelo ha xona, mina HOSI.	When an ox or sheep or goat is born, it shall remain seven days with its mother, and from the eighth day on it shall be acceptable as a food offering to the LORD.
Loko mi tlhava homu ya ntswele kumbe nyimpfu ya ntswele, mi nga tshuki mi yi tlhava siku rin'we ni n'wana wa kona.	But you shall not kill an ox or a sheep and her young in one day.
Ni loko mi tlhava xifuwo xa magandzelo ya ku ndzi nkhensa mina HOSI, xi tlhaveni hi ndlela leyi yi nga ta endla leswaku ndzi mi tsakela.	And when you sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving to the LORD, you shall sacrifice it so that you may be accepted.
Nyama ya kona yi fanele ku dyiwa hinkwayo siku leri xi tlhaviwaka; mi nga tshuki mi siya yin'wana yi tshama ku kondza ku fika siku leri tlhandlamaka. Hi mina HOSI.	It shall be eaten on the same day; you shall leave none of it until morning: I am the LORD.
Mi fanele ku hlayisa milawu ya mina, mi hanya ha yona. Hi mina HOSI.	So you shall keep my commandments and do them: I am the LORD.
Mi nga tshuki mi nyamisa vito ra mina; Vaisraele hinkwavo va fanele ku swi tiva leswaku ndzi hlawulekile; hi mina HOSI, Xikwembu lexi xi mi hlawulekisaka	And you shall not profane my holy name, that I may be sanctified among the people of Israel. I am the LORD who sanctifies you

HOSI Xikwembu xi byela Muxe	The LORD spoke to Moses, saying
ku ya tivisa Vaisraele marito ya xona lama nge: Ku ni masiku lawa ndzi ma vekeke ya minkhuvo, lawa mi faneleke ku hlengeletana ha wona mi ndzi gandzela mina HOSI; lawa hi wona masiku ya minkhuvo lawa ndzi ma vekeke.	Speak to the people of Israel and say to them, These are the appointed feasts of the LORD that you shall proclaim as holy convocations; they are my appointed feasts.
Mi ni masiku ya 6 lawa mi faneleke ku endla mintirho ya n'wina hinkwayo ha wona, kambe siku ra vu-7 i siku ro wisa ra Savata, leri mi faneleke ku hlengeletana ha rona mi ndzi gandzela. Hi siku leri, hinkwako lomu mi tshamaka kona, mi nga tshuki mi tirha ntirho ni wun'we; siku ra Savata ri hlawuleriwile mina HOSI.	Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest, a holy convocation. You shall do no work. It is a Sabbath to the LORD in all your dwelling places.
Minkhuvo leyi yi vekiweke yo tlangela mina HOSI, ma nga masiku lawa mi faneleke ku vitanana ha wona, mi hlengeletana mi ndzi gandzela, hi leyi	These are the appointed feasts of the LORD, the holy convocations, which you shall proclaim at the time appointed for them.
Hi siku ra vu-14 ra n'hweti yo sungula, hi minkarhi ya madyambu, ku ta va ni Nkhuvo wa Paseka wo tlangela mina HOSI.	In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at twilight, is the LORD's Passover.
Kutani hi siku ra vu-15 ra n'hweti leyi, ku ta sungula Nkhuvo wa Xinkwa lexo-ke-comela wo tlangela mina HOSI, lowu wu nga ta dyiwa masiku ya 7.	And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the Feast of Unleavened Bread to the LORD; for seven days you shall eat unleavened bread.
Hi siku ro sungula ra nkhuvo lowu, mi fanele ku hlengeletana mi ndzi gandzela, mi nga tirhi ntirho na wun'we lowu tikaka.	On the first day you shall have a holy convocation; you shall not do any ordinary work.
Emasikwini lawa ya 7, mi fanele ku ndzi humesela magandzelo mina HOSI. Hi siku ra vu-7 mi ta tlhela mi hlengeletana mi ndzi gandzela; hi siku leri, mi nga tshuki mi tirha ntirho na wun'we lowu tikaka.	But you shall present a food offering to the LORD for seven days. On the seventh day is a holy convocation; you shall not do any ordinary work.
HOSI Xikwembu xi byela Muxe	And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying
ku ya tivisa Vaisraele marito ya xona lama nge: Loko mi ta va mi fikile etikweni leri ndzi mi nyikaka rona, kutani mi tshovela leswi mi swi byaleke, mi fanele ku teka xirhundzu xa leswi mi nga ta rhanga mi swi tshovela, mi ya na xona eka muprista.	Speak to the people of Israel and say to them, When you come into the land that I give you and reap its harvest, you shall bring the sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest to the priest
Kutani hi siku leri landzaka ra Savata, muprista ú ta teka xirhundzu lexi, a ndzi widzela xona yi va nyiko ya mina leyo hlawuleka, leswaku ndzi ta mi tsakela.	and he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, so that you may be accepted. On the day after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it.
Hi siku leri mi humesaka xirhundzu xa nyiko leyo hlawuleka, mi fanele ku ndzi tlhavela xinyimpfana xa khuna xa lembe rin'we lexi nga solekiki, xi va xa magandzelo lama hisiwaka.	And on the day when you wave the sheaf, you shall offer a male lamb a year old without blemish as a burnt offering to the LORD.
Xinyimpfana lexi xi fanele ku humesiwa ni swintewana swimbirhi swa mapa lamanene lama pfanganyisiweke ni mafurha, leswaku ma va magandzelo lama hiseriwaka mina HOSI, lawa ku nun'hwela ka wona ku nga ta ndzi tsakisa; vhinyo leyi humesiwaka ni xinyimpfana lexi, yona yi ta va jomela rin'we.	And the grain offering with it shall be two tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil, a food offering to the LORD with a pleasing aroma, and the drink offering with it shall be of wine, a fourth of a hin.
Loko ku nga si fika siku leri mi tisaka ha rona magandzelo ya mina Xikwembu xa n'wina, mi nga tshuki mi dya swa nguva leyintshwa, xi nga va xinkwa, kumbe tindzhoho leti oxiweke, kumbe letimbisi. Nawu lowu mi fanele ku wu landza hilaha ku nga heriki, n'wina ni vatukulu va n'wina, hinkwako lomu mi nga ta va mi tshama kona.	And you shall eat neither bread nor grain parched or fresh until this same day, until you have brought the offering of your God: it is a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
Ku sukela siku leri mi ndzi tiselaka ha rona xirhundzu xa nyiko leyo hlawuleka, ri nga siku leri tlhandlamaka ra Savata, mi fanele ku hlayela mavhiki ya 7 lama heleleke.	You shall count seven full weeks from the day after the Sabbath, from the day that you brought the sheaf of the wave offering.
Siku leri tlhandlamaka ra Savata ya vu-7, ri ta va ra vu-50; hi siku leri mi fanele ku ta ni swa nguva leyintshwa, mi ta ndzi humesela ha swona magandzelo ya swa le masin'wini.	You shall count fifty days to the day after the seventh Sabbath. Then you shall present a grain offering of new grain to the LORD.
Emutini wun'wana ni wun'wana, ku fanele ku huma swinkwa swimbirhi leswi swekiweke hi swintewana swimbirhi swa mapa lamanene lama cheriweke comela, leswaku swi ta va nyiko ya mina leyo hlawuleka eka leswi mi rhangeke hi swona mi tshovela.	You shall bring from your dwelling places two loaves of bread to be waved, made of two tenths of an ephah. They shall be of fine flour, and they shall be baked with leaven, as firstfruits to the LORD.
Swinkwa leswi swi ta humesiwa ni swifuwo swa magandzelo lama hisiwaka, swi nga swinyimpfana swa 7 swa lembe rin'we leswi nga solekiki, ni xinkuzana xin'we, ni tinyimpfu timbirhi ta makhuna, ku humesiwa ni mapa ya swona ni vhinyo ya kona, leswaku ma va magandzelo lawa ku nun'hwela ka wona ku nga ta ndzi tsakisa mina HOSI.	And you shall present with the bread seven lambs a year old without blemish, and one bull from the herd and two rams. They shall be a burnt offering to the LORD, with their grain offering and their drink offerings, a food offering with a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
Mi ta tlhava ni xiphongho xa lembe rin'we, xi va xa mhamba yo susa swidyoho, ni swinyimpfana swimbirhi swa makhuna swa lembe rin'we, swi va swa magandzelo ya xinakulobye.	And you shall offer one male goat for a sin offering, and two male lambs a year old as a sacrifice of peace offerings.
Muprista ú ta teka swinyimpfana leswi, a ndzi widzela swona ni xinkwa xo endliwa hi leswi mi rhangeke hi swona ku tshovela; swinyimpfana leswi ni xinkwa lexi, swi hlawuleriwe mina HOSI leswaku swi va swa vaprista.	And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits as a wave offering before the LORD, with the two lambs. They shall be holy to the LORD for the priest.
Hi siku roleri, mi fanele ku vitanana, mi hlengeletana mi ndzi gandzela, mi nga tirhi ntirho na wun'we lowu tikaka. Nawu lowu, mi fanele ku wu landza hinkwako lomu mi nga ta tshama kona, n'wina ni vatukulu va n'wina hilaha ku nga heriki.	And you shall make a proclamation on the same day. You shall hold a holy convocation. You shall not do any ordinary work. It is a statute forever in all your dwelling places throughout your generations.
Loko mi tshovela swa le masin'wini ya n'wina, mi nga tshoveli mi ya fika emakumu ka nsimu, naswona loko mi hetile ku tshovela, mi nga tlheli mi ya khwaja; siyani swin'wana, mi siyela swisiwana ni valuveri: Hi mina HOSI, Xikwembu xa n'wina.	And when you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not reap your field right up to its edge, nor shall you gather the gleanings after your harvest. You shall leave them for the poor and for the sojourner: I am the LORD your God.
HOSI Xikwembu xi byela Muxe	And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying
ku ya tivisa Vaisraele marito ya xona lama nge: Hi siku ro sungula ra n'hweti ya vu-7, mi fanele ku ba timhalamhala, mi vitanana, mi hlengeletana mi ndzi gandzela; leri i siku ro wisa lero hlawuleka, leri mi faneleke ku ndzi tsundzuka ha rona	Speak to the people of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you shall observe a day of solemn rest, a memorial proclaimed with blast of trumpets, a holy convocation.

HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe	And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying
Siku ra vu-10 ra n'hweti leyi ya vu-7 i siku ra ku basisa lava dyoheke. Hi siku leri, mi fanele ku titsona swakudya, mi hlengeletana mi ndzi gandzela, mi ndzi humesela magandzelo.

Vanhu hinkwavo lava nga ta tshuka va dya swin'wana esikwini rero, va ta hlongoriwa va suka exikarhi ka va ka vona.	For whoever is not afflicted on that very day shall be cut off from his people.
Naswona, un'wana ni un'wana loyi a tirhaka ntirho wihi na wihi hi siku leri, ndzi ta n'wi herisa a nyamalala exikarhi ka va ka vona.	And whoever does any work on that very day, that person I will destroy from among his people.
Hi siku leri, mi nga tshuki mi tirha ntirho na wun'we: Nawu lowu, mi fanele ku wu landza, n'wina ni vatukulu va n'wina lomu mi nga ta va mi tshama kona, hilaha ku nga heriki.	You shall not do any work. It is a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwelling places.

It shall be to you a Sabbath of solemn rest, and you shall afflict yourselves. On the ninth day of the month beginning at evening, from evening to evening shall you keep your Sabbath.
HOSI Xikwembu xi byela Muxe	And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying
ku ya tivisa Vaisraele marito ya xona lama nge: Hi siku ra vu-15 ra n'hweti leyi ya vu-7, ku ta sungula Nkhuvo wa Mintsonga wo tlangela mina HOSI. Nkhuvo lowu, wu ta teka masiku ya 7	Speak to the people of Israel, saying, On the fifteenth day of this seventh month and for seven days is the Feast of Booths to the LORD.

On the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the produce of the land, you shall celebrate the feast of the LORD seven days. On the first day shall be a solemn rest, and on the eighth day shall be a solemn rest.
Hi siku ro sungula ra nkhuvo, mi fanele ku kha mihandzu leyo saseka, mi tshova ni mincindzu, ni swiphundla, ni marhavi ya mirhi ya le minkoveni, kutani mi sungula ku cina mi tsaka emahlweni ka mina HOSI Xikwembu xa n'wina, ku kondza ku hela masiku ya 7.	And you shall take on the first day the fruit of splendid trees, branches of palm trees and boughs of leafy trees and willows of the brook, and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God seven days.
Nkhuvo lowu wa ku tlangela mina HOSI, mi ta wu endla lembe rin'wana ni rin'wana, wu teka masiku ya 7 eka n'hweti ya vu-7. Nawu lowu, mi fanele ku wu landza, n'wina ni vatukulu va n'wina, hilaha ku nga heriki.	You shall celebrate it as a feast to the LORD for seven days in the year. It is a statute forever throughout your generations; you shall celebrate it in the seventh month.
Emasikwini lawa ya 7, mi fanele ku tshama emintsongeni; un'wana ni un'wana loyi a nga Muisraele, a a tshame entsongeni	You shall dwell in booths for seven days. All native Israelites shall dwell in booths
kutani na vona vatukulu va n'wina va ta swi tiva leswaku loko ndzi mi humesile etikweni ra Egipta n'wina Vaisraele, ndzi mi tshamisile emintsongeni: Hi mina HOSI, Xikwembu xa n'wina.	that your generations may know that I made the people of Israel dwell in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.
Hi ndlela leyi, Muxe a tivisa Vaisraele ta minkhuvo leyi vekiweke yo tlangela HOSI Xikwembu.	Thus Moses declared to the people of Israel the appointed feasts of the LORD.
HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe	The LORD spoke to Moses, saying
Lerisa Vaisraele leswaku va ndzi tisela mafurha layo tenga lama humaka eka murhi wa mutlhwari, leswaku rivoni ri ta lumekiwa namadyambu siku rin'wana ni rin'wana.	Command the people of Israel to bring you pure oil from beaten olives for the lamp, that a light may be kept burning regularly.
Aroni ú ta ri veka ehandle ka xisirhelelo lexi sirhelelaka Areka ya Ntwanano eka Ntsonga lowo Hlawuleka, ri tshama ri ri karhi ri pfurha emahlweni ka mina HOSI ku sukela namadyambu ri kondza ri xa. Nawu lowu mi fanele ku wu hlayisa n'wina ni vatukulu va n'wina hilaha ku nga heriki.	Outside the veil of the testimony, in the tent of meeting, Aaron shall arrange it from evening to morning before the LORD regularly. It shall be a statute forever throughout your generations.
Naswona Aroni ú fanele ku veketela timboni eka xitlhoma-timboni xa nsuku lowo tenga, ti tshama ti ri karhi ti pfurha masiku hinkwawo emahlweni ka mina HOSI.	He shall arrange the lamps on the lampstand of pure gold before the LORD regularly.
U fanele ku lava mapa lamanene, u sweka swinkwa swa 12, xinkwa xin'wana ni xin'wana u xi sweka hi mapa ya swintewana swimbirhi.	You shall take fine flour and bake twelve loaves from it; two tenths of an ephah shall be in each loaf.
Swinkwa leswi, u ta swi veka ehenhla ka tafula ra nsuku lowo tenga hi tinxaxa timbirhi, rixaxa rin'we ri va ni swinkwa swa 6.	And you shall set them in two piles, six in a pile, on the table of pure gold before the LORD.
Erixaxeni rin'wana ni rin'wana, u ta veka murhi lowu tengeke wa risuna wo suma swinkwa, lowu wu nga ta humeseriwa mina HOSI.	And you shall put pure frankincense on each pile, that it may go with the bread as a memorial portion as a food offering to the LORD.
Aroni ú ta veketela swinkwa emahlweni ka mina a yimela Vaisraele siku rin'wana ni rin'wana ra Savata; ntwanano lowu wu ta tirha hilaha ku nga heriki.	Every Sabbath day Aaron shall arrange it before the LORD regularly; it is from the people of Israel as a covenant forever.
Swinkwa leswi swi ta va swa Aroni ni vana va yena; va ta swi dyela exivandleni lexi hlawulekeke, hikuva swi ta va xiphemu lexo hlawuleka ngopfu lexi va nga ta hamba va nyikiwa xona hilaha ku nga heriki, eka magandzelo lama humeseriwaka mina HOSI.	And it shall be for Aaron and his sons, and they shall eat it in a holy place, since it is for him a most holy portion out of the LORD's food offerings, a perpetual due.
X	Now an Israelite woman's son, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the people of Israel. And the Israelite woman's son and a man of Israel fought in the camp
X	and the Israelite woman's son blasphemed the Name, and cursed. Then they brought him to Moses. His mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.
va fika va n'wi veka leswaku a rindziwa ku kondza va tivisiwa leswi HOSI Xikwembu xi lavaka swona emhakeni leyi.	And they put him in custody, till the will of the LORD should be clear to them.
Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying
Humesa munhu loyi a rhukaneke a ya ehandle ka mixaxa, u fika u byela vanhu lava va n'wi tweke leswaku va tlhandleka mavoko enhlokweni ya yena, kutani u lerisa ntshungu hinkwawo leswaku wu n'wi khandla hi maribye a fa.	Bring out of the camp the one who cursed, and let all who heard him lay their hands on his head, and let all the congregation stone him.
Kutani u tivisa Vaisraele leswaku hinkwavo lava va rhuketelaka Xikwembu xa vona, va tivangela khombo.	And speak to the people of Israel, saying, Whoever curses his God shall bear his sin.
Loyi a sandzaka vito ra mina HOSI, ú ta dlayiwa, ntshungu hinkwawo wu ta n'wi khandla hi maribye a fa; a nga va muluveri, kumbe Muisraele, loko a sandza vito ra mina, ú ta dlayiwa.	Whoever blasphemes the name of the LORD shall surely be put to death. All the congregation shall stone him. The sojourner as well as the native, when he blasphemes the Name, shall be put to death.
Munhu loyi a dlayaka un'wana, ú fanele ku dlayiwa na yena.	Whoever takes a human life shall surely be put to death.
Loyi a dlayaka xifuwo xa un'wana munhu, ú fanele ku humesa xifuwo xo siva lexi feke; vutomi byi rihiwa hi vutomi.	Whoever takes an animal's life shall make it good, life for life.
Munhu loyi a lamataka munhu-kulobye, na yena ú fanele ku endliwa sweswi a nga endla loyi un'wana swona	If anyone injures his neighbor, as he has done it shall be done to him
Ku tshoveka ka rhambu swi rihiwa hi ku tshoveka ka rhambu, tihlo hi tihlo, tino hi tino; leswi a n'wi lamatiseke xiswona, na yena ú fanele ku lamatisiwa xiswona.	fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; whatever injury he has given a person shall be given to him.
Loyi a dlayaka xifuwo xa un'wana munhu, ú fanele ku humesa xin'wana xo siva lexi feke; kasi loyi a dlayaka munhu un'wana, na yena ú fanele ku dlayiwa.	Whoever kills an animal shall make it good, and whoever kills a person shall be put to death.
Eka munhu un'wana na un'wana, a nga va muluveri kumbe Muisraele, mi fanele ku tirhisa nawu wun'we: Hi mina HOSI, Xikwembu xa n'wina.	You shall have the same rule for the sojourner and for the native, for I am the LORD your God.
Hiloko Muxe a ya a ya tivisa Vaisraele marito lawa, kutani vona va teka loyi a rhukaneke, va n'wi humesela ehandle ka mixaxa, va fika va n'wi khandla hi maribye, a fa. Hi ndlela leyi, Vaisraele va endla hilaha HOSI Xikwembu xi leriseke Muxe hakona.	So Moses spoke to the people of Israel, and they brought out of the camp the one who had cursed and stoned him with stones. Thus the people of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses.
HOSI Xikwembu xi vulavula na Muxe entshaveni ya Sinayi, xi n'wi byela	The LORD spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai, saying
ku ya tivisa Vaisraele marito ya xona lama nge: Loko mi ta va mi nghenile etikweni leri ndzi mi nyikaka rona, mi ta ndzi kombisa xichavo hi ku wisisa masimu ya n'wina, mi nga ma rimi hi lembe ra vu-7.	Speak to the people of Israel and say to them, When you come into the land that I give you, the land shall keep a Sabbath to the LORD.
Mi nga rima masimu ya n'wina malembe ya 6, mi tshena ni mirhi ya n'wina ya vhinya, mi hlengeleta mihandzu ya kona	For six years you shall sow your field, and for six years you shall prune your vineyard and gather in its fruits
kambe lembe rin'wana ni rin'wana ra vu-7, ri ta va lembe ra Savata ra ku wisisa masimu; mi ta ndzi kombisa xichavo hi ku tshika ku rima masimu ya n'wina hi lembe rero, mi nga tsheni ni mirhi ya n'wina ya vhinya.	but in the seventh year there shall be a Sabbath of solemn rest for the land, a Sabbath to the LORD. You shall not sow your field or prune your vineyard.
Leswi salaka swi timilela hi swoxe endzhaku ka ntshovelo wa lembe ra vu-6, mi nga tshuki mi swi tshovela; na yona mihandzu leyi nga ta sala yi huma emirhini ya n'wina ya vhinya leyi mi nga yi tshenangiki, mi nga tshuki mi yi hlengeleta, hikuva hi lembe rero mi fanele ku nyika masimu ya n'wina nkarhi wa ku wisa.	You shall not reap what grows of itself in your harvest, or gather the grapes of your undressed vine. It shall be a year of solemn rest for the land.
Hambiswiritano, leswi swi nga ta va kona elembeni leri ro wisisa masimu, mi ta dya swona n'wina, ni malandza ya n'wina ya xinuna ni ya xisati, ni vatirhi va n'wina lava mi va tholeke, ni vanhu lava luveleke exikarhi ka n'wina.	The Sabbath of the land shall provide food for you, for yourself and for your male and female slaves and for your hired worker and the sojourner who lives with you
Naswona swifuwo swa n'wina ni swiharhi swa nhova swi ta dya hinkwaswo leswi nga ta va kona etikweni.	and for your cattle and for the wild animals that are in your land: all its yield shall be for food.
Ntsengo wa malembe ya 7, mi fanele ku wu andzisa hi 7, leswaku malembe ya kona hinkwawo ma endla 49.	You shall count seven weeks of years, seven times seven years, so that the time of the seven weeks of years shall give you forty-nine years.
Kutani hi siku ra vu-10 ra n'hweti ya vu-7, ri nga siku lerikulu ra ku susa swidyoho, mi ta ba timhalamhala etikweni ra n'wina hinkwaro.	Then you shall sound the loud trumpet on the tenth day of the seventh month. On the Day of Atonement you shall sound the trumpet throughout all your land.
Hi ndlela leyi, mi ta hlawulekisa lembe ra vu-50, mi tivisa vaaki hinkwavo va tiko leswaku va kumile ku ntshunxeka; ri ta va lembe leri vuriwaka ‘ra Jubili’, leri un'wana ni un'wana a nga ta tlhela a kuma masimu lawa a ma ri ya yena khale, a pfumeleriwa ni ku tlhelela endyangwini wa ka vona.	And you shall consecrate the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you, when each of you shall return to his property and each of you shall return to his clan.
Lembe leri ra vu-50 i ra Jubili: Mi nga tshuki mi rima masimu ya n'wina, naswona mi nga tshuki mi tshovela leswi nga sala swi mila emasin'wini, kumbe ku hlengeleta mihandzu ya mirhi ya vhinya leyi nga tsheniwangiki.	That fiftieth year shall be a jubilee for you; in it you shall neither sow nor reap what grows of itself nor gather the grapes from the undressed vines.
I lembe ra Jubili, leri mi fanelaka ku ri hlawulekisa: Mi ta dya ntsena leswi nga ta va swi ri kona etikweni lembe rero.	For it is a jubilee. It shall be holy to you. You may eat the produce of the field.
Hi lembe leri ra Jubili, un'wana ni un'wana ú ta tlhela a kuma masimu lawa a ma ri ya yena khale.	In this year of jubilee each of you shall return to his property.
Hikokwalaho, loko mi xaviselana swilo, mi nga tshuki mi kanganyisana.	And if you make a sale to your neighbor or buy from your neighbor, you shall not wrong one another.
Mi fanele ku xava kumbe ku xavisa masimu hi ku ya hi ntsengo wa malembe lama hundzeke ku sukela Jubili yo hetelela, ni ntsengo wa malembe ya ku tshovela lama ha saleke.	You shall pay your neighbor according to the number of years after the jubilee, and he shall sell to you according to the number of years for crops.
Loko Jubili leyi taka ya ha ri kule, nxavo wu fanele ku ya ehenhla; loko Jubili yi ri kusuhani, nxavo a wu ye ehansi, hikuva leswi xavisiwaka i ntsengo wa malembe lawa ku nga ta va na ntshovelo.	If the years are many, you shall increase the price, and if the years are few, you shall reduce the price, for it is the number of the crops that he is selling to you.
Mi nga tshuki mi kanganyisana emhakeni leyi, kambe mi fanele ku chava mina Xikwembu xa n'wina: Hi mina HOSI.	You shall not wrong one another, but you shall fear your God, for I am the LORD your God.
Hlayisani milawu ni swiletelo swa mina, mi hanya ha swona, kutani mi ta va ni ku rhula etikweni.	Therefore you shall do my statutes and keep my rules and perform them, and then you will dwell in the land securely.
Tiko ra n'wina ri ta mi mirisela swakudya, kutani mi ta dya mi xurha, mi tshama mi hlayisekile.	The land will yield its fruit, and you will eat your fill and dwell in it securely.
Mi nga tshuka mi vutisa mi ku: ‘Leswi hi nga ta ka hi nga rimi hi lembe ra vu-7, xana hi ta dya yini, hikuva hi ta va hi nga tshovelanga nchumu?’	And if you say, 'What shall we eat in the seventh year, if we may not sow or gather in our crop?'
Hi lembe ra vu-6, ndzi ta mi rhumela minkateko, kutani tiko ra n'wina ri ta mi humesela swakudya swo ringana malembe manharhu.	I will command my blessing on you in the sixth year, so that it will produce a crop sufficient for three years.
Loko mi ya sungula ku rima hi lembe ra vu-8, mi ta va ma ha dya swa lembe ra vu-6, kutani mi ta swi dya mi kondza mi tshovela swa lembe ra vu-8.	When you sow in the eighth year, you will be eating some of the old crop; you shall eat the old until the ninth year, when its crop arrives.
Loko mi xavisa misava, mi nga yi xaviseli makumu, hikuva i ya mina; n'wina mi vanhu lava va ngo ta va famba, mi lo luvela eka mina.	The land shall not be sold in perpetuity, for the land is mine. For you are strangers and sojourners with me.
Etikweni ra n'wina hinkwaro, ku fanele ku va ni ndlela yo kutsula masimu.	And in all the country you possess, you shall allow a redemption of the land.
Loko un'wana wa Vaisraele a tshuka a wela evusiwaneni, kutani a xavisa masimu ya yena, un'wana wa ka vona loyi a nga muhlayisi wa yena ú ta ya a ya ma kutsula.	If your brother becomes poor and sells part of his property, then his nearest redeemer shall come and redeem what his brother has sold.
Munhu loyi a xaviseke masimu ya yena, a nga tshuka a pfumala muhlayisi, kambe a tlhela a kateka, a kuma leswi ringanaka ku ya kutsula masimu lawa.	If a man has no one to redeem it and then himself becomes prosperous and finds sufficient means to redeem it
Loko swi va tano, ú fanele ku hlayela malembe lama saleke ku ya fika eka lembe ra Jubili, kutani a hakela leswi ringanaka malembe lama saleke, hi kona muxavi wa masimu ya yena a nga ta n'wi tlherisela wona.	let him calculate the years since he sold it and pay back the balance to the man to whom he sold it, and then return to his property.
Loko a pfumala swo kutsula ha swona masimu ya yena, ma ta va ya loyi a ma xaveke ku kondza ku ya fika lembe ra Jubili. Hi lembe ra Jubili, masimu ma ta tlheriseriwa n'wini wa wona wa khale.	But if he does not have sufficient means to recover it, then what he sold shall remain in the hand of the buyer until the year of jubilee. In the jubilee it shall be released, and he shall return to his property.
Loko munhu loyi a tshamaka emutini wo rhendzeriwa hi rirhangu a xavisa yindlu ya yena, a nga ha tlhela a yi kutsula loko ku nga si hundza tin'hweti ta 12; loko ku nga si hundza lembe leri heleleke, wa pfumeleriwa ku kutsula yindlu ya yena.	If a man sells a dwelling house in a walled city, he may redeem it within a year of its sale. For a full year he shall have the right of redemption.
Kambe loko a nga yi kutsuli ku kondza ku hundza nkarhi wo ringana lembe, loyi a yi xaveke ú ta kuma yindlu yoleyo yi va ya yena ni vatukulu va yena hilaha ku nga heriki; naswona a yi nga tlherisiwi hambiloko ku fika lembe ra Jubili.	If it is not redeemed within a full year, then the house in the walled city shall belong in perpetuity to the buyer, throughout his generations; it shall not be released in the jubilee.
Loko ti ri tindlu ta le swimitaneni leswi nga biyeleriwangiki, tona ti fana ni masimu lama nga kona etikweni; ta kutsuriwa, naswona hi lembe ra Jubili ti tlheriseriwa vinyi va tona.	But the houses of the villages that have no wall around them shall be classified with the fields of the land. They may be redeemed, and they shall be released in the jubilee.
Hi tlhelo ra Valevhi, vona va pfumeleriwa ku kutsula tindlu ta vona leti nga mitini ya vona nkarhi wihi na wihi.	As for the cities of the Levites, the Levites may redeem at any time the houses in the cities they possess.
Loko Mulevhi un'wana a xavisa yindlu, kambe a nga ha tlheli a ya yi kutsula, yindlu yoleyo yi fanele ku tlherisiwa hi lembe ra Jubili, hikuva tindlu leti nga mitini ya Valevhi ti fanele ku tshama ti ri ta vona exikarhi ka Vaisraele.	And if one of the Levites exercises his right of redemption, then the house that was sold in a city they possess shall be released in the jubilee. For the houses in the cities of the Levites are their possession among the people of Israel.
Loko ma ri madyelo ya swifuwo lama rhendzeleke miti ya vona hinkwayo, wona ma nga tshuki ma xavisiwa; ma ta va ya vona hilaha ku nga heriki.	But the fields of pastureland belonging to their cities may not be sold, for that is their possession forever.
Loko un'wana wa Vaisraele a tshuka a wela evusiwaneni, a pfumala swo hanya hi swona, n'wi hlayiseni, mi n'wi khoma ku fana na muendzi kumbe muluveri.	If your brother becomes poor and cannot maintain himself with you, you shall support him as though he were a stranger and a sojourner, and he shall live with you.
Mi nga tshuki mi lava ntswalo eka leswi mi n'wi lombaka swona hi ndlela yihi kumbe yihi, kambe mi fanele ku chava mina Xikwembu xa n'wina, leswaku Muisraele wa ka n'wina a ta tshama exikarhi ka n'wina.	Take no interest from him or profit, but fear your God, that your brother may live beside you.
Loko mi n'wi lomba mali, mi nga tshuki mi lava ntswalo wa yona; ni loko mi n'wi nyika swakudya, mi nga tshuki mi n'wi hakerisa.	You shall not lend him your money at interest, nor give him your food for profit.
Hi mina HOSI Xikwembu xa n'wina. Ndzi mi humesile etikweni ra Egipta leswaku ndzi ta mi nyika tiko ra Kanana, ni leswaku ndzi ta va Xikwembu xa n'wina.	I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your God.
Loko Muisraele loyi a tshamaka kusuhi na wena a tshuka a wela evusiwaneni, kutani a ta a ta tixavisa eka wena, u nga tshuki u n'wi tirhisa ku fana ni hlonga.	If your brother becomes poor beside you and sells himself to you, you shall not make him serve as a slave
A a tshame na wena ku fana ni munhu loyi u nga lo n'wi thola kunene kumbe muluveri, a ku tirhela ku kondza ku fika lembe ra Jubili.	he shall be with you as a hired worker and as a sojourner. He shall serve with you until the year of the jubilee.
Hi lembe ra Jubili, a a suke emutini wa wena, a tlhelela eka va ka vona, yena ni vana va yena, a ya tshama endzhakeni ya vakokwa wa yena.	Then he shall go out from you, he and his children with him, and go back to his own clan and return to the possession of his fathers.
Vaisraele i malandza ya mina lawa ndzi ma humeseke etikweni ra Egipta, hikokwalaho, va nga tshuki va xavisiwa va va mahlonga.	For they are my servants, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt; they shall not be sold as slaves.
Mi nga tshuki mi va tirhisa hi tihanyi, kambe mi fanele ku chava mina Xikwembu xa n'wina.	You shall not rule over him ruthlessly but shall fear your God.
Loko mi lava ku va ni mahlonga ya xinuna ni ya xisati, mi fanele ku ya mi ya ma xava exikarhi ka vamatiko lava va mi rhendzeleke.	As for your male and female slaves whom you may have: you may buy male and female slaves from among the nations that are around you.
Mi nga ha xava mahlonga hambi exikarhi ka vanhu va le handle lava va teke ni mindyangu ya vona va ta luvela exikarhi ka n'wina; vanhu vo tano va nga va mahlonga ya n'wina ya xiviri.	You may also buy from among the strangers who sojourn with you and their clans that are with you, who have been born in your land, and they may be your property.
Mahlonga lawa, ma nga va ndzhaka ya n'wina leyi mi nga ta yi siyela vana va n'wina, leswaku ma va mahlonga ya vona hilaha ku nga heriki. Vanhu va le handle, mi nga va endla mahlonga ya n'wina, kambe Vaisraele va ka n'wina, vona mi nga tshuki mi va tirhisa hi tihanyi.	You may bequeath them to your sons after you to inherit as a possession forever. You may make slaves of them, but over your brothers the people of Israel you shall not rule, one over another ruthlessly.
Munhu loyi a ngo va xi-ta-xi-famba, kumbe loyi a luveleke exikarhi ka n'wina, a nga tshuka a kateka a va ni rifuwo, kambe Muisraele loyi a akelaneke na yena a wela evusiwaneni, kutani a ya tixavisa eka munhu loyi wo ta a famba kumbe eka un'wana wa vana va muluveri loyi.	If a stranger or sojourner with you becomes rich, and your brother beside him becomes poor and sells himself to the stranger or sojourner with you or to a member of the stranger's clan
Loko a tixavisile, swa pfumeleriwa leswaku a ya a ya kutsuriwa; un'wana wa vamakwavo wa yena a nga ya a ya n'wi kutsula.	then after he is sold he may be redeemed. One of his brothers may redeem him
Hambi a ri un'wana wa vamakwavo wa tata wa yena kumbe un'wana wa vana va makwavo wa tata wa yena, kumbe un'wana wa va ka vona, a nga ya a ya n'wi kutsula; naswona hambi a ri yena a nga tikutsula loko o tshuka a katekile a va ni swa le mandleni.	or his uncle or his cousin may redeem him, or a close relative from his clan may redeem him. Or if he grows rich he may redeem himself.
Ú fanele ku ya a ya vulavula ni muxavi wa yena, va hlayela malembe lawa ma ha saleke ku ya fika eka Jubili leyi ya ha taka. Mali yo hakelela ku ntshunxiwa ka yena yi ta fambelana ni malembe lawa ma ha saleke ku ya fika eka Jubili. Malembe lawa a tshameke wona eka muxavi wa yena, wona ma hlayiwa wonge a a lo thoriwa.	He shall calculate with his buyer from the year when he sold himself to him until the year of jubilee, and the price of his sale shall vary with the number of years. The time he was with his owner shall be rated as the time of a hired worker.
X	If there are still many years left, he shall pay proportionately for his redemption some of his sale price.
X	If there remain but a few years until the year of jubilee, he shall calculate and pay for his redemption in proportion to his years of service.
Muisraele loyi a tixaviseke, ú fanele ku tekiwa ku fana na munhu loyi a thoriweke nkarhi wo ringana lembe rin'we; mi nga tshiki muxavi wa yena a n'wi tirhisa hi tihanyi mi ri karhi mi swi vona.	He shall treat him as a worker hired year by year. He shall not rule ruthlessly over him in your sight.
Loko a nga kutsuriwanga hi yin'wana ya tindlela leti, ú ta ntshunxiwa hi lembe ra Jubili, yena ni vana va yena.	And if he is not redeemed by these means, then he and his children with him shall be released in the year of jubilee.
Vaisraele, ndzi va teka va ri malandza ya mina lawa ndzi ma humeseke etikweni ra Egipta. Hi mina HOSI, Xikwembu xa n'wina.	For it is to me that the people of Israel are servants. They are my servants whom I brought out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.
Etikweni ra n'wina, mi nga tshuki mi tiendlela swikwembu swa hava, naswona mi nga tiyimiseli swifaniso swa swona, ni timhandze ta vugandzeri bya hava, kumbe ku sasekisa maribye mi gandzela wona. Hi mina HOSI, Xikwembu xa n'wina.	You shall not make idols for yourselves or erect an image or pillar, and you shall not set up a figured stone in your land to bow down to it, for I am the LORD your God.
Mi fanele ku hlayisa masiku ya mina ya Savata, mi xixima ni xivandla xa mina lexo hlawuleka: Hi mina HOSI, Xikwembu xa n'wina.	You shall keep my Sabbaths and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD.
Hlayisani milawu ya mina, mi yingisa ni swileriso swa mina, mi hanya ha swona.	If you walk in my statutes and observe my commandments and do them
Loko mi endla sweswo, ndzi ta mi nisela mpfula hi tinguva ta kona, kutani masimu ya n'wina ma ta humesa ntshovelo lowo tala, ni mirhi ya n'wina ya mihandzu yi ta tswala swinene.	then I will give you your rains in their season, and the land shall yield its increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.
Ntshovelo wa n'wina wu ta va wu tele ngopfu: Hi nkarhi wo kha mihandzu ya vhinya, mi ta va ma ha hula koroni, kasi na yona vhinya mi ta yi kha ku kondza ku ya fika xirimo. Mi ta va mi tshamisekile, mi dya mi xurha.	Your threshing shall last to the time of the grape harvest, and the grape harvest shall last to the time for sowing. And you shall eat your bread to the full and dwell in your land securely.
Ndzi ta endla leswaku ku va na ku rhula etikweni, kutani loko mi etlele, a mi nga chavisiwi hi nchumu; hambi swi ri swiharhi leswo dlaya ndzi ta swi susa etikweni, ni tinyimpi a ti nga mi ngheneli.	I will give peace in the land, and you shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid. And I will remove harmful beasts from the land, and the sword shall not go through your land.
Mi ta kota ku hlongorisa valala va n'wina, mi va hlula hi fumu.	You shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.
Vavanuna va ka n'wina va ntlhanu va nga hlongorisa valala va 100, kasi vavanuna va 100 va nga hlongorisa valala va 10 000; mi ta swi kota ku hlula valala va n'wina hi fumu.	Five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand, and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.
Ndzi nga ka ndzi nga mi tshiki; ndzi ta endla leswaku mi va ni vana lavo tala, ndzi tlhela ndzi tiyisa ni ntwanano lowu ndzi wu endleke na n'wina.	I will turn to you and make you fruitful and multiply you and will confirm my covenant with you.
Ntshovelo wa lembe rin'we, mi ta wu dya ku kondza ku fika ntshovelo wa lembe leri landzelaka; mi ta kala mi wu humesela eswitlatini leswaku mi ta kuma ndhawu ya ntshovelo lowuntshwa.	You shall eat old store long kept, and you shall clear out the old to make way for the new.
Xivandla lexi ndzi nga ta tshama eka xona, xi ta va exikarhi ka n'wina; ndzi nga ka ndzi nga hambani na n'wina.	I will make my dwelling among you, and my soul shall not abhor you.
Ndzi ta va kona exikarhi ka n'wina, ndzi va Xikwembu xa n'wina, na n'wina mi va vanhu va mina.	And I will walk among you and will be your God, and you shall be my people.
Hi mina HOSI, Xikwembu xa n'wina lexi xi mi humeseke etikweni ra Egipta, leswaku mi nga ha vi mahlonga ya Vaegipta. Ndzi susile mpingu lowu a mi rhwexiwile wona, leswaku na n'wina mi ta va vanhu exikarhi ka van'wana vanhu.	I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, that you should not be their slaves. And I have broken the bars of your yoke and made you walk erect.
Kasi loko mi nga ndzi yingisi, ni loko mi tshika ku hanya hi swileriso swa mina	But if you will not listen to me and will not do all these commandments
ni loko mi fularhela milawu ya mina, mi tihambanisa ni swiletelo swa mina, mi nga endli leswi ndzi mi lerisaka swona, kutani mi tshova ntwanano wa mina	if you spurn my statutes, and if your soul abhors my rules, so that you will not do all my commandments, but break my covenant
ndzi ta mi endla leswi: Ndzi ta mi rhumela swilo swo chavisa ngopfu; mi ta va ni vuvabyi bya xifuva ni dari, byi mi dlaya mahlo byi mi heta ni matimba. Mi ta rima swilo leswi n'wina mi nga ta ka mi nga swi dyi, swi ta dyiwa hi valala va n'wina.	then I will do this to you: I will visit you with panic, with wasting disease and fever that consume the eyes and make the heart ache. And you shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.
Ndzi ta mi tshika, kutani valala va n'wina va ta mi hlula; mi ta fumiwa hi vanhu lava va nga mi tsakeriki, mi ta tshama mi ri eku tsutsumeni mi nga hlongorisiwi hi munhu.	I will set my face against you, and you shall be struck down before your enemies. Those who hate you shall rule over you, and you shall flee when none pursues you.
Loko hinkwaswo leswi swi nga endli leswaku mi ndzi yingisa, ndzi ta mi ba ku tlula ka 7, ndzi mi bela swidyoho swa n'wina.	And if in spite of this you will not listen to me, then I will discipline you again sevenfold for your sins
Nkanu leyi endlaka leswaku mi tikurisa, ndzi ta yi herisa; ndzi ta pfala tilo ri tiya wonge i nsimbhi, ndzi nonon'hwisa misava yi tiya kukota koporo.	and I will break the pride of your power, and I will make your heavens like iron and your earth like bronze.
Mi ta tirha, kambe mi to tirhela mahala, hikuva masimu ya n'wina a ma nga humesi ntshovelo wo nyawula, ni mirhi ya n'wina ya mihandzu a yi nga tswali nchumu.	And your strength shall be spent in vain, for your land shall not yield its increase, and the trees of the land shall not yield their fruit.
Loko mo ya emahlweni ni ku endla leswi ndzi nga swi laviki, mi ala ku ndzi yingisa, ndzi ta mi rhumela man'wana makhombo lama tlulaka layo sungula ka 7, hikwalaho ka swidyoho swa n'wina.	Then if you walk contrary to me and will not listen to me, I will continue striking you, sevenfold for your sins.
Ndzi ta rhumela swiharhi swa nhova exikarhi ka n'wina, kutani swi ta mi hetela vana, swi mi dlayela ni swifuwo swa n'wina; ku ta sala vanhu va nga ri vangani, kutani mabudula ya n'wina a ma nga ha pfhumbi.	And I will let loose the wild beasts against you, which shall bereave you of your children and destroy your livestock and make you few in number, so that your roads shall be deserted.
Loko mo ka mi nga ndzi yingisi mina ndzi mi tshinyeke hi ndlela leyi, ni loko mi ya emahlweni mi endla leswi ndzi nga swi laviki	And if by this discipline you are not turned to me but walk contrary to me
na mina ndzi ta endla leswi mi nga ta ka mi nga swi lavi; ndzi ta mi ba ka 7 ku tlula leswo sungula, hikwalaho ka swidyoho swa n'wina.	then I also will walk contrary to you, and I myself will strike you sevenfold for your sins.
Leswi mi nga ta va mi tshovile ntwanano, ndzi ta rihisela hi ku mi rhumela tinyimpi. Loko mo ya mi ya hlengeletana emitini ya n'wina, ndzi ta mi vangela mintungu, mi tlhela mi nyiketiwa emavokweni ya valala va n'wina.	And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall execute vengeance for the covenant. And if you gather within your cities, I will send pestilence among you, and you shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.
Swakudya swa n'wina ndzi ta swi hunguta swinene; vavasati va khume va ta sweka mbita yin'we, va mi phamela swona hi mpimo, kambe mi ta dya mi nga xurhi.	When I break your supply of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in a single oven and shall dole out your bread again by weight, and you shall eat and not be satisfied.
Loko hinkwaswo leswi swi nga endli leswaku mi ndzi yingisa, kambe mi ya emahlweni ni ku endla leswi ndzi nga swi laviki	But if in spite of this you will not listen to me, but walk contrary to me
na mina ndzi ta endla leswi mi nga ta ka mi nga swi lavi; ndzi ta mi ba ndzi hlundzukile, ndzi mi ba ka 7 ku tlula leswo sungula, hikwalaho ka swidyoho swa n'wina.	then I will walk contrary to you in fury, and I myself will discipline you sevenfold for your sins.
Mi ta pfumala swakudya mi kala mi dlaya vana va n'wina va xinuna ni va xisati mi dya nyama ya vona.	You shall eat the flesh of your sons, and you shall eat the flesh of your daughters.
Ndzi ta herisa switsunga swa n'wina leswo hlawuleka, ndzi fayetela ni tialitari leti mi hiselaka eka tona mirhi ya risuna, ndzi mi dlaya ndzi cukumeta mintsumbu ya n'wina ehenhla ka mintsumbu ya swifaniso swa swikwembu swa n'wina swa hava. Mi ta va mi ndzi nyangatsile ngopfu	And I will destroy your high places and cut down your incense altars and cast your dead bodies upon the dead bodies of your idols, and my soul will abhor you.
lero ndzi ta mbundzumuxela miti ya n'wina, ndzi herisa ni swivandla swa n'wina leswo hlawuleka; ni ku nun'hwela ka magandzelo ya n'wina a ku nga ha ndzi tsakisi.	And I will lay your cities waste and will make your sanctuaries desolate, and I will not smell your pleasing aromas.
Tiko ra n'wina ndzi ta ri onhetela; valala va n'wina lava va nga ta sala va tshama eka rona va ta hlamala swinene.	And I myself will devastate the land, so that your enemies who settle in it shall be appalled at it.
Ndzi ta mi vangela tinyimpi, ndzi mi hangalasa mi ya tshama exikarhi ka vamatiko. Etikweni ra n'wina ku ta sala ku nga ha ri na munhu, miti ya n'wina yi ta hundzuka marhumbi.	And I will scatter you among the nations, and I will unsheathe the sword after you, and your land shall be a desolation, and your cities shall be a waste.
Loko n'wina mi ta va ma ha ri ematikweni ya valala va n'wina, tiko ra n'wina ri ta sala ri va na nkarhi lowunene wa Savata, ri wisa hi ku hetiseka, hikuva ku ta va ku nga ha ri na munhu eka rona.	Then the land shall enjoy its Sabbaths as long as it lies desolate, while you are in your enemies' land; then the land shall rest, and enjoy its Sabbaths.
Enkarhini lowu ri nga ta va ri nga ri na munhu, ri ta va ni ku wisa loku a ri nga ku kumi emasikwini ya n'wina ya Savata loko ma ha tshama eka rona.	As long as it lies desolate it shall have rest, the rest that it did not have on your Sabbaths when you were dwelling in it.
Lava va nga ta va va ponile exikarhi ka n'wina, ndzi ta endla leswaku va tshama va ri ku chaveni kwale matikweni ya valala va n'wina. Loko va twa xo chakala, va ta suka va tsutsuma wonge vo va eku hlongorisiweni, va wa va nga hlongorisiwi hi munhu.	And as for those of you who are left, I will send faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies. The sound of a driven leaf shall put them to flight, and they shall flee as one flees from the sword, and they shall fall when none pursues.
Va ta phijana va wa, wonge vo va eku balekeni ka nyimpi, kasi a ku na munhu loyi a va hlongorisaka. Mi ta pfumala ni matimba yo lwa ni valala va n'wina.	They shall stumble over one another, as if to escape a sword, though none pursues. And you shall have no power to stand before your enemies.
Mi ta fa mi hela ematikweni ya valala va n'wina.	And you shall perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.
Hinkwavo va ka n'wina lava va nga ta va va ponile va ta hela va nyamalala ematikweni ya valala va n'wina, va dlawela milandzu ya vona ni ya vatata wa vona, leyi na vona va feleke yona.	And those of you who are left shall rot away in your enemies' lands because of their iniquity, and also because of the iniquities of their fathers they shall rot away like them.
Hambiswiritano, vanhu lava va nga tshuka va tisola eka leswi va ndzi onheleke swona vona ni vatata wa vona, loko va vile ni tihanyi va nga endli leswi mina ndzi lavaka swona	But if they confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their fathers in their treachery that they committed against me, and also in walking contrary to me
kutani na mina ndzi endla leswi va nga swi laviki, ndzi va yisa ematikweni ya valala va vona. Naswona, vanhu lava va nga tlhela va hundzuka hi ku hetiseka, va hambana ni mikhuva ya vona leyo biha.	so that I walked contrary to them and brought them into the land of their enemies—if then their uncircumcised heart is humbled and they make amends for their iniquity
Loko vo endla sweswo, ndzi ta tsundzuka ntwanano lowu ndzi wu endleke na Yakobo ni lowu ndzi wu endleke na Isaka, ni lowu ndzi wu endleke na Abrahama, ndzi tsundzuka ni tiko ra vona.	then I will remember my covenant with Jacob, and I will remember my covenant with Isaac and my covenant with Abraham, and I will remember the land.
Kambe va fanele ku rhanga va huma etikweni ri sala ri nga ha ri na munhu, leswaku ri ta kuma nkarhi wa rona wo wisa wa Savata, naswona va fanele ku biwa hikwalaho ka leswi va fularheleke swiletelo swa mina, va tshika ni milawu ya mina.	But the land shall be abandoned by them and enjoy its Sabbaths while it lies desolate without them, and they shall make amends for their iniquity, because they spurned my rules and their soul abhorred my statutes.
Hambiswiritano, loko va ri ematikweni ya valala va vona a ndzi nga va tshiki, kumbe ku nyangatseka ndzi va herisela makumu, hikuva sweswo swi nga herisa ntwanano lowu ndzi wu endleke na vona: Hi mina HOSI, Xikwembu xa vona.	Yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not spurn them, neither will I abhor them so as to destroy them utterly and break my covenant with them, for I am the LORD their God.
Ndzi ta va twela vusiwana, ndzi tsundzuka ntwanano lowu ndzi wu endleke ni vatata wa vona loko ndzi va humesile etikweni ra Egipta, vamatiko va ri karhi va swi vona, leswaku ndzi ta va Xikwembu xa vona: Hi mina HOSI.	But I will for their sake remember the covenant with their forefathers, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God: I am the LORD.
Leyi hi yona milawu ni swiletelo ni swileriso leswi HOSI Xikwembu xi swi nyikeke Muxe entshaveni ya Sinayi leswaku a ya swi fikisa eka Vaisraele.	These are the statutes and rules and laws that the LORD made between himself and the people of Israel through Moses on Mount Sinai.
HOSI Xikwembu xi vulavula na Muxe	The LORD spoke to Moses, saying
xi n'wi byela marito ya xona lawa a faneleke ku ya ma fikisa eka Vaisraele, xi ku ka yena: Un'wana a nga tshuka a hetisa leswi a tshembiseke swona hi ku hlambanya hi ku ndzi tisela munhu mina HOSI. Loko swi va tano, wena u fanele ku veka mali leyi yi nga humesiwaka ematshan'wini ya munhu wa kona.	Speak to the people of Israel and say to them, If anyone makes a special vow to the LORD involving the valuation of persons
Loko ku tisiwa wanuna wa malembe ya le xikarhi ka 20 na 60, mali yo kutsula yi ta va tisilivhere ta 50.	then the valuation of a male from twenty years old up to sixty years old shall be fifty shekels of silver, according to the shekel of the sanctuary.
Loko munhu wa kona a ri wansati wa malembe walawo, mali yo kutsula yi ta va tisilivhere ta 30.	If the person is a female, the valuation shall be thirty shekels.
Loko ku humesiwa munhu wa xinuna kumbe wa xisati wa le xikarhi ka malembe ya 5 ku ya fika 20, mali yo kutsula wa xinuna yi ta va tisilivhere ta 20, yo kutsula wa xisati yi ta va tisilivhere ta khume.	If the person is from five years old up to twenty years old, the valuation shall be for a male twenty shekels, and for a female ten shekels.
Vana lava nga xikarhi ka n'hweti yin'we ni malembe ya 5, loko a ri wa xinuna ú ta kutsuriwa hi mali ya tisilivhere ta 5, kasi wa xisati ú ta kutsuriwa hi tinharhu.	If the person is from a month old up to five years old, the valuation shall be for a male five shekels of silver, and for a female the valuation shall be three shekels of silver.
Munhu wa malembe ya 60 kumbe ku tlula, loko a ri wa xinuna ú ta kutsuriwa hi mali ya tisilivhere ta 15, kasi loko a ri wa xisati ú ta kutsuriwa hi tisilivhere ta khume.	And if the person is sixty years old or over, then the valuation for a male shall be fifteen shekels, and for a female ten shekels.
Loko loyi a tiboheke hi ku hlambanya a ri xisiwana, a tsandzeka ku hakela mali leyi vekiweke, a a yise munhu loyi a n'wi humesaka eka muprista, kutani muprista ú ta fika a veka mali leyi loyi a hlambanyeke a nga ta yi kota.	And if someone is too poor to pay the valuation, then he shall be made to stand before the priest, and the priest shall value him; the priest shall value him according to what the vower can afford.
Loko munhu a tibohile hi ku hlambanya ku ndzi humesela xin'wana xa swifuwo leswi vanhu va pfumeleriwaka ku ndzi humesela ha swona magandzelo, xifuwo xexo xi ta va xi hlawulekile.	If the vow is an animal that may be offered as an offering to the LORD, all of it that he gives to the LORD is holy.
A nga tshuki a xi kutsula hi xilo xin'wana, lexo saseka kumbe lexi nga sasekangiki. Loko a xi siva hi xifuwo xin'wana, swifuwo swa kona swi ta va swa mina hi vumbirhi bya swona.	He shall not exchange it or make a substitute for it, good for bad, or bad for good; and if he does in fact substitute one animal for another, then both it and the substitute shall be holy.
Munhu loyi a tiboheke hi ku hlambanya, a nga ta ni xifuwo lexi nga tengangiki, lexi vanhu va nga pfumeleriwiki ku ndzi humesela magandzelo ha xona. Loko swi va tano, munhu wa kona ú fanele ku xi yisa eka muprista.	And if it is any unclean animal that may not be offered as an offering to the LORD, then he shall stand the animal before the priest
Endzhaku ka loko muprista a langutile leswi nkhensekaka ni leswi nga nkhensekiki eka xifuwo lexi, ú ta veka mali yo xi kutsula. Mali leyi vekiweke a ya ha hundzuluxiwi.	and the priest shall value it as either good or bad; as the priest values it, so it shall be.
Loko n'wini wa xifuwo a lava ku xi kutsula, ú fanele ku humesa mali leyi muprista a vekeke yona, a tlhela a tlhandlekela hi xiphemu xa ⅕ xa mali ya kona.	But if he wishes to redeem it, he shall add a fifth to the valuation.
Loko munhu a nyiketa yindlu ya yena eka mina HOSI, muprista ú ta veka mali yo yi kutsula, hi ku ya hi leswi nkhensekaka ni leswi nga nkhensekiki eka yindlu ya kona. Mali leyi vekiweke hi muprista yi nga tshuki yi hundzuluxiwa.	When a man dedicates his house as a holy gift to the LORD, the priest shall value it as either good or bad; as the priest values it, so it shall stand.
Loko munhu loyi a nyiketeke yindlu ya yena eka mina HOSI a lava ku yi kutsula, ú fanele ku humesa mali leyi vekiweke, a tlhandlekela hi xiphemu xa ⅕ xa mali ya kona. Kutani yindlu leyi yi ta tlhela yi va ya yena.	And if the donor wishes to redeem his house, he shall add a fifth to the valuation price, and it shall be his.
Loko munhu a humesa yin'wana ya masimu lawa a siyeriweke wona hi vatata wa yena a nyika mina HOSI, mali yo yi kutsula yi fanele ku fambelana ni mbewu leyi nga byariwaka ensin'wini ya kona; loko mbewu ya kona yi ri ya maxalana yo tata masaka ya 10, mali yo kutsula yi ta va tisilivhere ta 50.	If a man dedicates to the LORD part of the land that is his possession, then the valuation shall be in proportion to its seed. A homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver.
Loko nsimu ya kona yi nyiketiwa eka mina HOSI lembe ra Jubili ra ha ku hela, mali yo yi kutsula yi ta va leyi heleleke.	If he dedicates his field from the year of jubilee, the valuation shall stand
Kambe loko munhu a nyiketa nsimu ya yena lembe ra Jubili ri hundzile khalenyana, muprista ú fanele ku veka mali yo kutsula hi ku ya hi malembe lama saleke ku ya fika eka Jubili leyi taka; mali ya kona yi fanele ku hungutiwa yi fambelana ni ntsengo wa malembe ya kona.	but if he dedicates his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall calculate the price according to the years that remain until the year of jubilee, and a deduction shall be made from the valuation.
Loko n'wini wa nsimu a lava ku yi kutsula, ú fanele ku humesa mali leyi vekiweke, a tlhandlekela hi xiphemu xa ⅕ xa yona, kutani nsimu yi ta tlhela yi va ya yena.	And if he who dedicates the field wishes to redeem it, then he shall add a fifth to its valuation price, and it shall remain his.
Kambe loko a nga lavi ku yi kutsula, kumbe a yi xavisela munhu un'wana, a yi nga ha kutsuriwi ni siku ni rin'we.	But if he does not wish to redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed anymore.
Kutani loko ku fika lembe ra Jubili leri nsimu a yi ta fanela ku tlhelela eka n'wini wa yona, yi ta va ya mina HOSI, yi ta fana ni xilo lexi nyiketiweke makumu eka mina.	But the field, when it is released in the jubilee, shall be a holy gift to the LORD, like a field that has been devoted. The priest shall be in possession of it.
Loko munhu a nyiketa eka mina HOSI nsimu leyi a yi xaveke kunene, leyi a nga siyeriwangiki hi vatata wa yena	If he dedicates to the LORD a field that he has bought, which is not a part of his possession
muprista ú fanele ku veka mali yo kutsula ha yona hi ku ya hi ntsengo wa malembe lawa ma ha saleke ku ya fika eka Jubili leyi taka, kutani loyi a nyiketaka nsimu ú fanele ku humesa mali hinkwayo siku rero; mali leyi yi hlawulekile, i ya mina HOSI.	then the priest shall calculate the amount of the valuation for it up to the year of jubilee, and the man shall give the valuation on that day as a holy gift to the LORD.
Hi lembe ra Jubili nsimu yi fanele ku tlhelela eka loyi a yi xaviseke ro sungula, a nga munhu loyi vatata wa yena va n'wi siyeleke yona.	In the year of jubilee the field shall return to him from whom it was bought, to whom the land belongs as a possession.
Mali yo kutsula ha yona yi fanele ku vekiwa hi ku ya hi ntiko wa lexi ku pimiwaka ha xona, lexi hlayisiwaka exivandleni lexo hlawuleka.	Every valuation shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall make a shekel.
Swifuwo swa mativula i swa mina HOSI, hikokwalaho ku nga vi na loyi a nge ú lava ku swi nyiketa eka mina; yi nga va homu ya mativula, kumbe nyimpfu ya mativula, yo va ya mina hi nawu.	But a firstborn of animals, which as a firstborn belongs to the LORD, no man may dedicate; whether ox or sheep, it is the LORD's.
Kambe loko xifuwo xa kona xi ri lexi nga tengangiki, n'wini wa xona a nga xi kutsula hi mali leyi vekiweke, a tlhandlekela hi xiphemu xa ⅕ xa yona. Loko xi nga kutsuriwi, xi fanele ku xavisiwa hi mali ya kona leyi vekiweke.	And if it is an unclean animal, then he shall buy it back at the valuation, and add a fifth to it; or, if it is not redeemed, it shall be sold at the valuation.
Xilo xin'wana na xin'wana lexi munhu a nga na xona, ku nga va munhu kumbe homu kumbe nsimu leyi a siyeriweke yona hi vatata wa yena, loko a kala a xi nyiketa eka mina, xi nga tshuki xi xavisiwa kumbe ku kutsuriwa, hikuva hinkwaswo leswi nyiketiweke eka mina swi hlawuleke ngopfu.	But no devoted thing that a man devotes to the LORD, of anything that he has, whether man or beast, or of his inherited field, shall be sold or redeemed; every devoted thing is most holy to the LORD.
Hambi a ri munhu, loko a nyiketiwile leswaku a dlayiwa, a nga tshuki a kutsuriwa, a a tekeriwe vutomi.	No one devoted, who is to be devoted for destruction from mankind, shall be ransomed; he shall surely be put to death.
Vukhume hinkwabyo bya leswi milaka etikweni, i bya mina HOSI; byi nga va bya swa le masin'wini kumbe bya mihandzu ya mirhi ya n'wina, vukhume byebyo byi hlawuleriwe mina HOSI.	Every tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the trees, is the LORD's; it is holy to the LORD.
Loko munhu a lava ku kutsula byin'wana vukhume bya yena, ú fanele ku tlhandlekela xiphemu xa ⅕ eka mali yo kutsula ha yona.	If a man wishes to redeem some of his tithe, he shall add a fifth to it.
Vukhume hinkwabyo bya swifuwo leswikulu ni leswitsongo, i bya mina HOSI. Loko swifuwo leswi nga tshangeni swi hlayiwa, xifuwo xin'wana ni xin'wana xa vukhume xi fanele ku hlawuleriwa mina.	And every tithe of herds and flocks, every tenth animal of all that pass under the herdsman's staff, shall be holy to the LORD.
N'wini wa xifuwo a nga fanelanga ku tiva loko xifuwo lexi xa vukhume xi hetisekile kumbe xi nga hetisekanga, naswona xifuwo xo tano a xi siviwi hi xin'wana. Loko munhu o endla sweswo, swifuwo swa kona swi ta va swa mina hi swimbirhi ka swona.	One shall not differentiate between good or bad, neither shall he make a substitute for it; and if he does substitute for it, then both it and the substitute shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.
Leyi hi yona milawu leyi HOSI Xikwembu xi yi leriseke Muxe entshaveni ya Sinayi leswaku a ya yi byela Vaisraele.	These are the commandments that the LORD commanded Moses for the people of Israel on Mount Sinai.
 Vana va Yakobo lava yeke etikweni ra Egipta na tata wa vona, va ri ni mindyangu ya vona, hi lava	These are the names of the sons of Israel who came to Egypt with Jacob, each with his household
Rhuveni, na Simiyoni, na Levhi, na Yuda	Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah
na Isakara, na Zebuloni, na Benjamini	Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin
na Dani, na Neftali, na Gadi, na Asere.	Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.
Vana va Yakobo ni vatukulu va yena hinkwavo a va ri 70, ku katsa na Yosefa loyi a ku ri khale a ri etikweni ra Egipta.	All the descendants of Jacob were seventy persons; Joseph was already in Egypt.
Swi fike laha Yosefa, ni vamakwavo hinkwavo, ni hinkwavo lava kuleke eminkarhini yoleyo, va hundzeke emisaveni.	Then Joseph died, and all his brothers and all that generation.
Kambe vanhu va rixaka ra Israele va tswalelene va andza, ntsengo wa vona wu ya wu kula, matimba ya vona ma engeteleka ngopfu swinene, kutani va tata tiko hinkwaro.	But the people of Israel were fruitful and increased greatly; they multiplied and grew exceedingly strong, so that the land was filled with them.
Loko ku hundzile nkarhi, ku vekiwa hosi leyintshwa etikweni ra Egipta; hosi leyi a yi tivanga nchumu hi Yosefa	Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who did not know Joseph.
kutani yi ku ka vanhu va yona: Ma swi vona leswaku Vaisraele va sungula ku hi tlula hi ku tala ka vona ni matimba ya vona!	And he said to his people, Behold, the people of Israel are too many and too mighty for us.
A hi va endleni hi mano leswaku va nga andzi ngopfu, hikuva loko va tala kutani nyimpi yi tshuka yi humelela, va ta yima ni valala va hina, va lwa na hina, kutani va ta suka etikweni va hi balekela.	Come, let us deal shrewdly with them, lest they multiply, and, if war breaks out, they join our enemies and fight against us and escape from the land.
Hiloko Vaegipta va veka valanguteri, leswaku va xanisa Vaisraele hi ku va rhwexa mintirho yo tika. Kutani Vaisraele va akela Faro miti ya Pitomu na Ramsese yo hlayisela tinhundzu ta yena eka yona.	Therefore they set taskmasters over them to afflict them with heavy burdens. They built for Pharaoh store cities, Pithom and Raamses.
