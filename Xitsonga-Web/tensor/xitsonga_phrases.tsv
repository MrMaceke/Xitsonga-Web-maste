Kambe swifuwo leswo tsana Yakobo a a nga swi vekeleli minkhavi	but for the feebler of the flock he would not lay them there

‘Leswi nga ni minkhwati-nkhwati swi ta va swona hakelo ya wena’	'The striped shall be your wages

Kutani va swi veka va vekela siku leri tlhandlamaka	So they laid it aside till the morning
hilaha Muxe a va leriseke hakona	as Moses commanded them
a swi onhakanga	and it did not stink
naswona a swi humanga swivungu	and there were no worms in it
Kutani Muxe a ku ka vona	Moses said
Namuntlha dyanani swona	Eat it today
hikuva i siku ra ku wisa ra Savata leri hlawuleriweke HOSI Xikwembu	for today is a Sabbath to the LORD

Kutani HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe	And the LORD said to Moses
Xana mi ta ala ku hlayisa swileriso ni milawu ya mina ku fikela rini xana	How long will you refuse to keep my commandments and my laws
Vaisraele va thya swakudya leswi evito ra manna	Now the house of Israel called its name manna
a swi ringana ni tindzhoho ta nhlampfurha	It was like coriander seed
swi basile	white
swi nyanganya ku fana ni ximbhundzwa lexi totiweke vulombe	and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey

mi hlayisela vatukulu va n'wina hinkwavo	'Let an omer of it be kept throughout your generations
va ta vona swakudya leswi a ndzi mi phamela swona emananga	so that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness

Kutani Muxe a lerisa Aroni a ku	And Moses said to Aaron
Teka xibya u chela xintewana xa manna eka xona	Take a jar
u ya xi veka emahlweni ka HOSI Xikwembu	and put an omer of manna in it
u xi hlayisela vatukulu va n'wina hinkwavo	and place it before the LORD to be kept throughout your generations
Kutani Aroni a endla hilaha HOSI Xikwembu xi leriseke Muxe hakona	As the LORD commanded Moses
a veka xibya lexi emahlweni ka Areka ya Ntwanano leswaku xi hlayiseka	so Aaron placed it before the testimony to be kept
Vaisraele va dyile manna ku ringana malembe ya 40	The people of Israel ate the manna forty years
ku kondza va ya fika etikweni leri a ri tshameka	till they came to a habitable land
va fikile endzilekaneni wa Kanana va ha dya manna	They ate the manna till they came to the border of the land of Canaan
(Mpimo wa xintewana lowu vuriwaka omere wu nghena ka khume eka mpimo lowu vuriwaka efa	(An omer is the tenth part of an ephah
)	)
Kutani va sungula ku holovela Muxe	Therefore the people quarreled with Moses and said
va ku ka yena	Give us water to drink
Hi nyike mati hi nwa! Muxe a va hlamula a ku	And Moses said to them
Mi ndzi holovelela yini xana	Why do you quarrel with me
Xana mi ringela yini HOSI Xikwembu xana	Why do you test the LORD
Hiloko HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe	And the LORD said to Moses
Hundzela emahlweni ka vanhu	Pass on before the people
u teka van'wana va vakulukumba va Israele	taking with you some of the elders of Israel
u rhanga na vona	and take in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile
u famba ni nhonga leyi u nga ba mati ya nambu hi yona	and go
Kutani Yoxuwa a hlula Vaamaleke hi matlhari	And Joshua overwhelmed Amalek and his people with the sword
Kutani Muxe a aka alitari	And Moses built an altar and called the name of it
a yi thya vito ra HOSI-i-mujeko-wanga	The LORD Is My Banner
Yetro a tsaka swinene	And Jethro rejoiced for all the good that the LORD had done to Israel
loko a twa mintirho leyinene leyi HOSI Xikwembu xi endleleke Vaisraele hi ku va kutsula emavokweni ya Vaegipta	in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians
Sweswi ndza swi tiva leswaku HOSI Xikwembu xi tlula swikwembu hinkwaswo	Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods

Kutani mukon'wana wa Muxe a ku	Moses' father-in-law said to him
Matirhele ya wena a ma hetisekanga	What you are doing is not good
Wena ni vanhu lava u nga na vona mi ta tidlaya hi mintirho	You and the people with you will certainly wear yourselves out

u nga ka u nga wu koti u ri wexe	You are not able to do it alone
Muxe a lelana ni mukon'wana wa yena	Then Moses let his father-in-law depart

Hi siku ra ku tshama ka n'hweti ya vunharhu endzhaku ka loko va humile etikweni ra Egipta	On the third new moon after the people of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt

Muxe a vulavula na Xikwembu	Moses spoke
kutani xona xi n'wi hlamula hi rito leri tlakukeke	and God answered him in thunder
HOSI Xikwembu xi ku ka Muxe	And the LORD said to him
Rhelela u ya vuya na Aroni	Go down
kambe u nga tshuki u pfumelela vaprista ni vanhu leswaku va tsemakanya ndzilekana va tlhandlukela eka mina HOSI Xikwembu	and come up bringing Aaron with you
hikuva loko va endla sweswo	But do not let the priests and the people break through to come up to the LORD
ndzi ta va hlundzukela ndzi va ba	lest he break out against them
Kutani Xikwembu xi vula marito lawa hinkwawo	And God spoke all these words
xi ku	saying
Hi mina HOSI Xikwembu xa wena	I am the LORD your God
lexi xi ku humeseke etikweni ra Egipta	who brought you out of the land of Egypt
ni le vuhlongeni bya kona	out of the house of slavery
U nga tshuki u tlanga hi vito ra mina	You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain
hikuva mina HOSI Xikwembu xa wena ndzi nga ka ndzi nga tshiki ku ba loyi a tlangaka hi vito ra mina	for the LORD will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain
Tsundzuka ku hlayisa siku ra Savata	Remember the Sabbath day

U nga tshuki u oswa	You shall not commit adultery
U nga tshuki u yiva	You shall not steal
U nga tshuki u lumbeta munhu-kuloni hi vumbhoni byo hemba	You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor
Kutani Muxe a hlamula Vaisraele	Moses said to the people
a ku	Do not fear
Mi nga chavi! Xikwembu xi tile ku ta mi kambela	for God has come to test you
mi ta hamba mi va ni xichavo eka xona	that the fear of him may be before you
mi nga ha dyohi	that you may not sin
Kutani Vaisraele va sala va yimile kule	The people stood far off
Muxe yena a tshinela kusuhi ni papa ra ntima leri Xikwembu a xi ri endzeni ka rona	while Moses drew near to the thick darkness where God was
Naswona mi nga khandziyi alitarini hi swikhandziyo	And you shall not go up by steps to my altar
hikuva vuhava bya n'wina byi nga vonaka	that your nakedness be not exposed on it
Milawu leyi u nga ta vekela Vaisraele	Now these are the rules that you shall set before them
Loko a tile ka wena a nga ri na nsati	If he comes in single
a a fambe a ri yexe	he shall go out single
Loko a tile a ri ni nsati	if he comes in married
a a fambe na yena	then his wife shall go out with him
n'wini wa rona ú ta ya na rona eka Xikwembu	then his master shall bring him to God
a ri yimisa ri khegetela rivanti kumbe rimba ra rona	and he shall bring him to the door or the doorpost
a ri boxa ndleve kwalaho hi ntlhavo	And his master shall bore his ear through with an awl
kutani ri ta va hlonga vutomi hinkwabyo	and he shall be his slave forever
Loko munhu a xavisa n'wana wa yena wa xisati ku va hlonga	When a man sells his daughter as a slave
n'wana loyi a nga ha ntshunxiwi ku fana ni mahlonga ya xinuna	she shall not go out as the male slaves do
Loko muxavi a n'wi xavela ku va nsati wa yena	If she does not please her master
kutani muxavi loyi a nga ha tsakisiwi hi yena	who has designated her for himself
a a n'wi pfumelele ku kutsuriwa	then he shall let her be redeemed
a nga tshuki a n'wi xavisela vanhu van'wana	He shall have no right to sell her to a foreign people
hikuva ú hoxerile nsati loyi ngopfu	since he has broken faith with her
Kambe loko a n'wi xavela ku va nsati wa n'wana wa yena wa xinuna	If he designates her for his son
ú ta n'wi hlayisa ku fana ni vana va yena va xisati	he shall deal with her as with a daughter
Loko a n'wi tsona swilo leswinharhu leswi	And if he does not do these three things for her
wansati ú ta suka a famba	she shall go out for nothing
a nga kutsuriwanga hi mali	without payment of money
Kasi loko a nga n'wi jumanga	But if he did not lie in wait for him
kambe a ri mina Xikwembu ndzi nga n'wi nyiketa leswaku a dlayiwa	but God let him fall into his hand
ndzi ta komba mudlayi lomu a nga ta tumbela kona	then I will appoint for you a place to which he may flee
Kambe munhu loyi a yelaka un'wana a ri ni makungu ya ku n'wi dlaya hi tihanyi	But if a man willfully attacks another to kill him by cunning
hambiloko a tumberile alitarini ya mina	you shall take him from my altar
ú fanele ku susiwa kona leswaku a ya dlayiwa	that he may die
Kambe loko hlonga ri kota ku hanya siku rin'we kumbe mambirhi ri nga si fa	But if the slave survives a day or two
rifu ra rona a ri fanelanga ku rihiwa	he is not to be avenged
hikuva n'wini wa rona ú lahlekeriwile hi xuma xa yena	for the slave is his money
tihlo hi tihlo	eye for eye
tino hi tino	tooth for tooth
voko hi voko	hand for hand
nenge hi nenge	foot for foot
ku tshwa hi ku tshwa	burn for burn
mbanga hi mbanga	wound for wound
felangati hi felangati	stripe for stripe
Loko a ba hlonga ra yena ra xinuna kumbe ra xisati a ri gula tino	If he knocks out the tooth of his slave
ú fanele ku ri ntshunxa ri tifambela	male or female
hi mhaka ya tino leri	he shall let the slave go free because of his tooth
Loko homu yi tlhava wanuna kumbe wansati yi n'wi dlaya	When an ox gores a man or a woman to death
yi fanele ku khandliwa hi maribye yi fa	the ox shall be stoned
nyama ya yona yi nga dyiwi	and its flesh shall not be eaten
kambe n'wini wa yona ú ta va a nga ri na nandzu	but the owner of the ox shall not be liable
Kambe homu leyi tshameke yi tlhava vanhu	But if the ox has been accustomed to gore in the past
kutani n'wini wa yona a tsundzuxiwa kambe a nga yi pfaleli etshangeni	and its owner has been warned but has not kept it in
loko yi dlaya wanuna kumbe wansati	and it kills a man or a woman
yi fanele ku khandliwa hi maribye yi fa	the ox shall be stoned
n'wini wa yona na yena ú faneriwile hi rifu	and its owner also shall be put to death
Kambe loko n'wini wa homu a tshuka a lerisiwile ku riha	If a ransom is imposed on him
ú fanele ku humesa hinkwaswo leswi a nga ta byeriwa ku kutsula vutomi bya yena ha swona	then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatever is imposed on him
Loko homu yi tlhava n'wana wa mufana kumbe wa nhwanyana wa munhu un'wana	If it gores a man's son or daughter
ka ha ta tirha nawu wolowo eka n'wini wa yona	he shall be dealt with according to this same rule
Loko munhu a tshika khele ri nga funengetiwanga	When a man opens a pit
kumbe loko a cela khele a nga ri funengeti	or when a man digs a pit and does not cover it
kutani ku wela homu kumbe mbhongolo endzeni ka rona	and an ox or a donkey falls into it
n'wini wa khele leri ú fanele ku riha xifuwo lexi feke	the owner of the pit shall make restoration
ú ta nyika n'wini wa xona emali	He shall give money to its owner
kambe xona xi ta va xa yena	and the dead beast shall be his
Loko homu ya munhu un'wana yi tlhava ya un'wana yi yi dlaya	When one man's ox butts another's
vinyi va tona va ta xavisa homu leyi hanyaka kutani va avelana mali ya kona	so that it dies
hambi yi ri homu leyi nga fa	then they shall sell the live ox and share its price
va fanele ku avanyiselana	and the dead beast also they shall share
Kambe loko swi tiveka leswaku homu leyi a yi tolovele ku tlhavetela tin'wana	Or if it is known that the ox has been accustomed to gore in the past
kutani n'wini wa yona a nga yi pfaleli etshangeni	and its owner has not kept it in
ú fanele ku riha homu hi ku humesa yin'wana	he shall repay ox for ox
yena a teka leyi yi nga fa	and the dead beast shall be his
Loko munhu a yiva homu kumbe nyimpfu	If a man steals an ox or a sheep
kutani a yi dlaya kumbe a yi xavisa	and kills it or sells it
homu ya kona ú ta yi riha hi ntlhanu wa tihomu	he shall repay five oxen for an ox
kasi nyimpfu yona ú ta yi riha hi mune wa tinyimpfu	and four sheep for a sheep
Kambe loko xifuwo lexi yiviweke xi kumiwa eka khamba leri xa ha hanya	If the stolen beast is found alive in his possession
hambi yi ri homu kumbe mbhongolo kumbe nyimpfu	whether it is an ox or a donkey or a sheep
khamba ri ta humesa swifuwo swimbirhi ku riha xin'we	he shall pay double
Loko vanhu vambirhi va lwetana hi xilo xihi ni xihi	For every breach of trust
ku fana ni homu	whether it is for an ox
kumbe mbhongolo	for a donkey
kumbe nyimpfu	for a sheep
kumbe swiambalo	for a cloak
kumbe nchumu wihi ni wihi lowu lahlekeke	or for any kind of lost thing
kutani un'wana a ku i swa yena	of which one says
mhaka ya vanhu lavambirhi lava yi fanele ku tisiwa eka mina Xikwembu	'This is it
loyi ndzi nga ta n'wi kuma a ri ni nandzu	' the case of both parties shall come before God
ú ta rihela loyi un'wana kambirhi	The one whom God condemns shall pay double to his neighbor
Loko xifuwo xi handzuleriwile hi swiharhi swa nhova	If it is torn by beasts
loyi a a fuyisiwile a a xi tise xi ta voniwa leswaku xi handzuleriwile	let him bring it as evidence
kutani a nga ka a nga rihisiwi	He shall not make restitution for what has been torn
Loko munhu a lomba xifuwo eka nakulobye	If a man borrows anything of his neighbor
kutani xifuwo lexi xi vavisiwa kumbe xi fa	and it is injured or dies
n'wini wa xona a nga ri kona	the owner not being with it
loyi a lombeke xona ú fanele ku riha	he shall make full restitution
Kambe loko n'wini wa xona a ri kona loko swi humelela	If the owner was with it
loyi a lombeke a nga fanelanga ku riha	he shall not make restitution
Loko xifuwo a xi lombiwile hi mali	if it was hired
mali ya kona hi yona yi rihaka	it came for its hiring fee
Kambe loko tata wa nhwanyana a ala leswaku n'wana wa yena a tekiwa hi munhu loyi	If her father utterly refuses to give her to him
wanuna wa kona ú fanele ku riha hi mali leyi ringanaka ntsengo lowu lovolaka nhwana loyi a nga si tivanaka ni wanuna	he shall pay money equal to the bride-price for virgins
Un'wana ni un'wana loyi a etlelaka ni xifuwo ú fanele ku herisiwa	Whoever lies with an animal shall be put to death
Un'wana ni un'wana loyi a humeselaka swikwembu swin'wana emagandzelo	Whoever sacrifices to any god
ematshan'wini ya ku gandzela mina HOSI ntsena	other than the LORD alone
ú fanele ku herisiwa	shall be devoted to destruction
Mi nga tshuki mi khoma valuveri hi tihanyi kumbe ku va xanisa	You shall not wrong a sojourner or oppress him
hikuva na n'wina mi vile valuveri etikweni ra Egipta	for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt
Mi nga tshuki mi xanisa noni kumbe n'wana loyi a nga feriwa hi vatswari	You shall not mistreat any widow or fatherless child
Loko mo va xanisa	If you do mistreat them
kutani va ta va ta rila eka mina	and they cry out to me
ku rila ka vona ndzi ta ku twa hakunene	I will surely hear their cry
Loko mi lomba un'wana wa vanhu va mina loyi mi nga na yena wa xisiwana emali	If you lend money to any of my people with you who is poor
mi nga tshuki mi n'wi sala ndzhaku kukota lava bindzulaka hi ku lombisa mali	you shall not be like a moneylender to him
naswona mi nga lavi ntswalo wa mali leyi mi yi lombeke xisiwana lexi	and you shall not exact interest from him
Loko u tshuka u tekile xiambalo xa nakuloni loyi a nga ni nandzu eka wena	If ever you take your neighbor's cloak in pledge
u fanele ku n'wi tlherisela xona dyambu ri nga si pela	you shall return it to him before the sun goes down
hikuva hi wona nkumba wa yena	for that is his only covering
ú sirhelela miri wa yena ha yona	and it is his cloak for his body
xana ku nga va ni xin'wana lexi a etlelaka a funengerile xona xana	in what else shall he sleep
Loko a ta a ta rila eka mina	And if he cries to me
ku rila ka yena ndzi ta ku twa	I will hear
hikuva mina ndzi twela vanhu vusiwana	for I am compassionate
Mi nga tshuki mi ndzi sandza mina Xikwembu	You shall not revile God
kumbe ku rhuketela murhangeri wa vanhu va ka n'wina	nor curse a ruler of your people
Vana va n'wina va xinuna va mativula	You shall not delay to offer from the fullness of your harvest and from the outflow of your presses
mi fanele ku ndzi nyiketa vona	The firstborn of your sons you shall give to me
Mi ta endlisa sweswo ni le ka tihomu ta n'wina ni tinyimpfu ta n'wina	You shall do the same with your oxen and with your sheep
Xifuwo xa mativula xi fanele ku tshama ni mana wa xona masiku ya 7	seven days it shall be with its mother
kambe hi siku ra vu-8 mi ta ndzi tisela xona	on the eighth day you shall give it to me
Mi nga tshuki mi hangalasa timhaka leti nga riki na vumbhoni	You shall not spread a false report
Mi nga tshuki mi humesa vumbhoni byo hemba hi ku yima ni munhu wo homboloka ehubyeni	You shall not join hands with a wicked man to be a malicious witness
Loko u vona munhu loyi a ku vengaka a ri ni mbhongolo leyi weke ni ndzwalo	If you see the donkey of one who hates you lying down under its burden
u nga n'wi tshiki na yona	you shall refrain from leaving him with it
n'wi pfune ku yi pfuxa	you shall rescue it with him
Chavani ku lumbeta van'wana	Keep far from a false charge
naswona mi nga tshuki mi dlaya loyi a nga riki na nandzu kumbe loyi a lulameke	and do not kill the innocent and righteous
hikuva ndzi nga ka ndzi nga tshiki nandzu wa lava endlaka vubihi byo tano	for I will not acquit the wicked
Mi nga tshuki mi xanisa muluveri	You shall not oppress a sojourner
hikuva na n'wina mi vile valuveri etikweni ra Egipta	You know the heart of a sojourner
kutani ma swi tiva leswi ku va muluveri swi nga xiswona	for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt
Mi fanele ku ndzi tlangela hi minkhuvo minharhu elembeni	Three times in the year you shall keep a feast to me
Mi ta endla Nkhuvo wa Xinkwa lexo-ke-comela	You shall keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread

kutani ndzi ta mi katekisa hi ku mi nyika vuswa ni mati	and he will bless your bread and your water
ndzi ta susa ni mavabyi exikarhi ka n'wina	and I will take sickness away from among you
Ndzi ta ba mindzilekana ya tiko ra n'wina yi sukela eka Lwandle-ro-Tshwuka ku ya fika eLwandle ra Vafilista	And I will set your border from the Red Sea to the Sea of the Philistines
ni ku suka emananga ya Sinayi ku ya fika enambyeni wa Yufrata	and from the wilderness to the Euphrates
hikuva ndzi ta nyiketa vaaki va tiko emavokweni ya n'wina	for I will give the inhabitants of the land into your hand
mi va hlongola va suka emahlweni ka n'wina	and you shall drive them out before you
Mi nga tshuki mi endla ntwanano na vona kumbe ku endla ntwanano ni swikwembu swa vona	You shall make no covenant with them and their gods
Vanhu lava a va fanelanga ku tshama etikweni ra n'wina	They shall not dwell in your land
hikuva va nga mi kokela eku ndzi dyoheleni	lest they make you sin against me
naswona loko mi gandzela swikwembu swa vona	for if you serve their gods
mi ta va mi tiphasa hi ntlhamu	it will surely be a snare to you
Wena Muxe	Moses alone shall come near to the LORD
hi wena ntsena u nga ta tshinela kusuhi na mina HOSI	but the others shall not come near
lava u nga na vona va nga tshuki va ta kusuhi	and the people shall not come up with him
Kutani Muxe a tsala hinkwaswo leswi vuriweke hi HOSI Xikwembu	And Moses wrote down all the words of the LORD
Siku leri tlhandlamaka a pfuka nimixo swinene	He rose early in the morning and built an altar at the foot of the mountain
a aka alitari ehansi ka ntshava	and twelve pillars
